["The County of Blois was originally centred on Blois, south of Paris, France. One of the chief cities, along with Blois itself, was Chartres. \n\n\n== History ==\nBlois was associated with Champagne Province, the House of Ch\u00e2tillon (who tended to reside in Blois), the Dukes of Brittany and, later, with the French royal family. Theobald I, Count of Blois served as Regent to Drogo, Duke of Brittany. Bertha of Blois, the daughter of Odo II of Blois, became Duchess Consort of Brittany through her marriage to Alan II, Duke of Brittany. Stephen Henry's son Stephen of Blois became King of England. Charles de Blois, son of Guy I, Count of Blois, married Joan of Penthievre, the heiress of John III, Duke of Brittany; together, they became principal protagonists in the War of the Breton Succession. Upon the death of his only son, Guy II, Count of Blois sold the county to Louis I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans and the county passed to the French royal family.\nBlois was important during the Hundred Years' War; Joan of Arc based herself there.\nThe extent of the county varied over time. The northern portion, bordering on Normandy, was sometimes alienated as the County of Chartres, but the Counts of Blois who possessed it did not use a separate title for it. These lands were finally sold to the crown by Joan, Countess of Blois in 1291. In 1439, the area around Ch\u00e2teaudun was separated as Dunois for Jean de Dunois, appointed Count of Dunois.\n\n\n== First Creation (832) ==\nTitle held by House of Blois.\n\n832\u2013834: William, Count of Blois, Count of Ch\u00e2teaudun; created by Louis the Pious.\n834\u2013865: Odo I, Count of Blois, Count of Ch\u00e2teaudun, Count of Troyes\n865\u2013866: Robert, Count of Blois, Count of Troyes; title disbanded due to annexation to Marches of Neustria.\n\n\n== Second Creation (960) ==\nTitle held by House of Blois.\n\n960\u2013975: Theobald I, Count of Tours, Count of Chartres\n975\u2013996: Odo I, Count of Blois, Count of Tours, Count of Chartres\n996\u20131004: Theobald II, Count of Blois, Count of Tours, Count of Chartres\n1004\u20131037: Odo II, Count of Blois, Count of Tours, Count of Chartres; also Count of Champagne since 1022.\n1037\u20131089: Theobald III, Count of Blois, Count of Tours, Count of Chartres; also Count of Champagne since 1066.\n1089\u20131102: Stephen I & II, Count of Blois, Count of Chartres; father of Stephen, King of England.\n1102\u20131152: Theobald IV & II, Count of Blois, Count of Chartres; also Count of Champagne since 1125.\n1152\u20131191: Theobald V, Count of Blois, Count of Chartres\n1191\u20131205: Louis I, Count of Blois, Count of Chartres, Count of Clermont\n1205\u20131218: Theobald VI, Count of Blois, Count of Chartres, Count of Clermont\n1218\u20131230: Margaret, Countess of Blois\nJure uxoris 1218\u20131230: Walter II, Lord of Avesnes\n\n\n== Third Creation (1230) ==\nTitle held by House of Avesnes.\n\n1230\u20131241: Mary, Countess of Blois\nJure uxoris 1226\u20131241: Hugh I, Count of Saint-Pol\n\n\n== Fourth Creation (1241) ==\nTitle held by House of Ch\u00e2tillon.\n\n1241\u20131280: John I, Count of Blois, Count of Dunois, Lord of Avesnes; also Count of Chartres since 1248.\n1280\u20131291: Joan, Countess of Blois, Countess of Dunois Lady of Avesnes; also Countess of Chartres before 1286.\n1291\u20131307: Hugh II, Count of Blois, Count of Dunois, Lord of Avesnes; previously Count of Saint-Pol.\n1307\u20131342: Guy I, Count of Blois, Count of Dunois, Lord of Avesnes\n1342\u20131346: Louis II, Count of Blois, Count of Dunois, Lord of Avesnes; fell in the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy.\n1346\u20131372: Louis III, Count of Blois, Count of Dunois, Lord of Avesnes\n1372\u20131381: John II, Count of Blois, Count of Dunois, Lord of Avesnes; lost the War of the Guelderian Succession.\n1381\u20131391: Guy II, Count of Blois, Count of Dunois, Lord of Avesnes\nAfter the death of his only son Guy II sell his titles anf fiefdoms to Louis I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, who never used the title, like his successors.\n\n\n== References ==", "Agdistis satanas is a moth in the family Pterophoridae.

He also studied with the Philadelphia Association and apprenticed in existential therapy with R.D. Laing. In 1983, Ticktin obtained an MRCPsych in Psychiatry through the Royal College of Psychiatrists in London, and in the course of the decades during which Ticktin made the UK his home, he helped to found the British Network of Alternatives to Psychiatry and the Supportive Psychotherapy Association.\nHe joined the editorial collective of Asylum in 1987 and has published articles in a number of British psychiatry journals. Ticktin has also been a visiting lecturer and supervisor at the Regent's College School of Psychotherapy and Counselling, and at The New School of Psychotherapy and Counselling at Schiller International University, where he worked with Emmy van Deurzen. In 2004, he returned to Canada where he is currently in private practice and is also adjunct faculty at the Living Institute in Toronto.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\"The User's Voice in Mental Health Services\" in Asylum: Magazine for Democratic Psychiatry, Vol. 5 (3) 1991\n\"Friendship, Therapy, Camaraderie: An Existential Approach to Therapy With Young People\" in Case Studies in Existential Psychotherapy, Simon Du Plock, Ed.

They were perhaps most known for their mutant metallic cover of Prince's \"Kiss\" which topped the UK Indie Chart in 1986, and peaked at No. 50 in the UK Singles Chart in January the following year. Despite signing for major label Virgin, and being favourites with the UK music press, they never enjoyed a major hit in the UK, although \"Don't Get Mad\u2026 Get Even\" reached No. 8 on the US Billboard Hot Dance/Club Play chart.Musically they were a mixture of punk, hip hop, industrial rock and Northern soul. Steven E provided a distinctive strident nasal vocal style, often employing a megaphone. Striking cover art visuals were a collaboration between the group and The Designers Republic, who would go on to graphic design fame. They were the first band to be remixed by Public Enemy - AKA Hank Shocklee and Carl Ryder, who remixed \u201cTake it\u201d from \u201c1000 Years of Trouble\u201d (1988). They were contemporaries of Pop Will Eat Itself, whose music also featured rock guitar, dance beats and copious samples, and other early UK samplist groups such as Coldcut and The JAMMs.\n\n\n== History ==\nSteve Elvidge was a Leeds native, and attended St Michael's College (R.C.); being the most notable musical alumnus of that school since Jake Thackray. Neil Howson, (guitar) also from Leeds studied at Jacob Kramer College of Art, Geoff Taylor (Liverpool) and Jan Perry (Stockport) were students at Leeds Polytechnic, now Leeds Metropolitan University.\nAge of Chance first came to national attention in 1985, when their debut single, \"Motorcity/ Everlasting Yeah\" released on their own label, Riot Bible, was picked up and championed by BBC Radio 1 DJ, John Peel. A session followed, recorded at Maida vale studios and four songs, \"Going, Going Gone Man\", \"Mob Hut\", \"The Morning After the Sixties\" and \"I Don't Know and I Don't Care\" were recorded. \"I Don't Know..\" was re-recorded for Gunfire and Pianos, a compilation album released by Zigzag magazine.\nThey released their second self-funded single, \"Bible of the Beats\" / \"Liquid Jungle\" in January 1986, which led to an invitation to contribute a track, \"From Now On, This Will Be Your God\" on the NME C86 compilation tape. The band made their London debut at the ICA Rock week in July 1986. A second Peel session was recorded in June 1986, with \"Be Fast, Be Clean, Be Cheap\", \"From Now On, This Will be Your God\", \"Kiss\" and \"How the West was Won\". \"Kiss\" was recorded for the John Peel session while the Prince single was still in the charts.\nThe band then signed to the Sheffield independent record label, Fon, for \"Kiss\" and its remix 12\"s and six track mini-LP Crush Collision.  \"Kiss\" was No. 2 in John Peel's Festive Fifty for 1986.The band signed to Virgin in January 1987, and embarked on a nationwide UK tour. They recorded a Janice Long session comprising \"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Noise\", \"Hold On\" and \"Bible of the Motorcity Beats.\" They began recording their first single for Virgin with producer Howard Gray: \"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Noise/Big Bad Rap\" and then started their first Virgin album, One Thousand Years of Trouble. A second single \"Don't Get Mad, Get Even\" was released in October, followed by the album. In 1988, Channel 4 began using \"Don't Get Mad...\" as the music for the American Football programme, which ran over the next three years. The band began recording their second Virgin album in the summer at Rockfield in Wales.\nOriginal singer Steven-E left in September 1988, during the recording of their second LP, forcing the rest of the band to recruit a new singer, Charles Hutchinson, in January 1989, and \"re-vocal\" the LP, which was released as Mecca in 1990. The main single from that collection, \"Higher Than Heaven\" reached No. 53 in the UK, despite being voted \"record of the week\" by BBC Radio 1's breakfast show listeners. When Hutchinson left, Perry took on vocal duties briefly before the band split in 1991.\n\n\n== Cover art ==\n\nA strong visual identity was developed by the band, from their clothes (notably featuring cycling tops, the idea for which came after seeing a cyclist standing at the bar in The Faversham public house in Leeds) to their cover art. The first singles had a punk like cut-up graphic design produced by the band featuring slogans and mini-manifestos. \"Stay Young!! Say Yeah!! Call Each Other Bay-Beah!!\" \"You CAN live forever with the Age of Chance\". The slogans and visual imagery were passed to The Designers Republic who produced a series of classic cover designs for the Kiss releases and the series of 1987 Virgin releases. The sleeve of Don't Get Mad ... Get Even was one of Q Magazine's 100 Best Record Covers Of All Time (2001), with the citation describing the collaborations as \"Too intricate to rightfully exist in the pre-desktop publishing age, the sleeves were edgy, loaded, with menacing visual manifestos adorned with slogans ... alongside bar codes, cruise missiles and (first woman in space)Valentina Tereshkova's face.\" \nDesigner Ian Anderson recalled that \"The way they were presented was very much as a philosophy; it was a punk attitude crossed with disco styling, that asked questions to get a reaction. Once the vocabulary was set, the sleeves almost designed themselves. We may have done the designs, but the language was created by the band.\"\n\n\n== Line-up ==\nSteven Elvidge (vocals)\nGeoff Taylor (bass guitar)\nNeil Howson (lead guitar)\nJan Perry (percussion)\nCharles Hutchinson (vocals on Mecca)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nKiss Crush Collision (mini LP, 1986) (UK Indie No. 4)\nOne Thousand Years of Trouble (1987)\nMecca (1990)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Motorcity\" (1985) (UK Indie No. 26)\n\"Bible of the Beats\" (1986) (UK Indie No. 3)\n\"The Twilight World of Sonic Disco EP\" (collecting first 2 7\" singles, 1986)\n\"Kiss\" (1986) (UK Indie No. 1) (re-issued 1987) UK No. 50, (NZ No.21)\n\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Noise\" (1987) (NZ No.34)\n\"Don't Get Mad ...

The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The current champion is France, which won its second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia.\nThe current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the World Cup Finals. After this, 32 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month.\nThe 21 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight national teams. Brazil have won five times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, France and inaugural winner Uruguay, with two titles each; and England and Spain with one title each.\nThe World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games; the cumulative viewership of all matches of the 2006 World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population of the planet.17 countries have hosted the World Cup. Brazil, France, Italy, Germany and Mexico have each hosted twice, while Uruguay, Switzerland, Sweden, Chile, England, Argentina, Spain, the United States, Japan and South Korea (jointly), South Africa and Russia have each hosted once. Qatar are planned as hosts of the 2022 finals, and 2026 will be jointly hosted by Canada, the United States and Mexico, which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to have hosted games in three finals.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Previous international competitions ===\nThe world's first international football match was a challenge match played in Glasgow in 1872 between Scotland and England, which ended in a 0\u20130 draw. The first international tournament, the inaugural British Home Championship, took place in 1884. As football grew in popularity in other parts of the world at the start of the 20th century, it was held as a demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics (however, the IOC has retroactively upgraded their status to official events), and at the 1906 Intercalated Games.After FIFA was founded in 1904, it tried to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been a failure.At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, football became an official competition. Planned by The Football Association (FA), England's football governing body, the event was for amateur players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great Britain (represented by the England national amateur football team) won the gold medals. They repeated the feat at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm.\nWith the Olympic event continuing to be contested only between amateur teams, Sir Thomas Lipton organised the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy tournament in Turin in 1909. The Lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs (not national teams) from different nations, each one of which represented an entire nation. The competition is sometimes described as The First World Cup, and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from Italy, Germany and Switzerland, but the FA of England refused to be associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a professional team. Lipton invited West Auckland, an amateur side from County Durham, to represent England instead. West Auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title.\nIn 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the Olympic tournament as a \"world football championship for amateurs\", and took responsibility for managing the event. This paved the way for the world's first intercontinental football competition, at the 1920 Summer Olympics, contested by Egypt and 13 European teams, and won by Belgium. Uruguay won the next two Olympic football tournaments in 1924 and 1928. Those were also the first two open world championships, as 1924 was the start of FIFA's professional era.\n\n\n=== World Cups before World War II ===\n\nDue to the success of the Olympic football tournaments, FIFA, with President Jules Rimet as the driving force, again started looking at staging its own international tournament outside of the Olympics. On 28 May 1928, the FIFA Congress in Amsterdam decided to stage a world championship itself. With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions and to celebrate their centenary of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country of the inaugural World Cup tournament.\nThe national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for European sides. Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition. Rimet eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia to make the trip. In total, 13 nations took part: seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America.\n\nThe first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously on 13 July 1930, and were won by France and the USA, who defeated Mexico 4\u20131 and Belgium 3\u20130 respectively. The first goal in World Cup history was scored by Lucien Laurent of France. In the final, Uruguay defeated Argentina 4\u20132 in front of 93,000 people in Montevideo, and became the first nation to win the World Cup. After the creation of the World Cup, FIFA and the IOC disagreed over the status of amateur players, and so football was dropped from the 1932 Summer Olympics. Olympic football returned at the 1936 Summer Olympics, but was now overshadowed by the more prestigious World Cup.\nThe issues facing the early World Cup tournaments were the difficulties of intercontinental travel, and war. Few South American teams were willing to travel to Europe for the 1934 World Cup and all North and South American nations except Brazil and Cuba boycotted the 1938 tournament. Brazil was the only South American team to compete in both. The 1942 and 1946 competitions, which Germany and Brazil sought to host, were cancelled due to World War II and its aftermath.\n\n\n=== World Cups after World War II ===\n\nThe 1950 World Cup, held in Brazil, was the first to include British participants. British teams withdrew from FIFA in 1920, partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with, and partly as a protest against foreign influence on football, but rejoined in 1946 following FIFA's invitation. The tournament also saw the return of 1930 champions Uruguay, who had boycotted the previous two World Cups. Uruguay won the tournament again after defeating the host nation Brazil, in the match called \"Maracanazo\" (Portuguese: Maracana\u00e7o).\nIn the tournaments between 1934 and 1978, 16 teams competed in each tournament, except in 1938, when Austria was absorbed into Germany after qualifying, leaving the tournament with 15 teams, and in 1950, when India, Scotland, and Turkey withdrew, leaving the tournament with 13 teams. Most of the participating nations were from Europe and South America, with a small minority from North America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. These teams were usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams. Until 1982, the only teams from outside Europe and South America to advance out of the first round were: USA, semi-finalists in 1930; Cuba, quarter-finalists in 1938; North Korea, quarter-finalists in 1966; and Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1970.\n\n\n=== Expansion to 32 teams ===\n\nThe tournament was expanded to 24 teams in 1982, and then to 32 in 1998, also allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part. Since then, teams from these regions have enjoyed more success, with several having reached the quarter-finals: Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1986; Cameroon, quarter-finalists in 1990; South Korea, finishing in fourth place in 2002; Senegal, along with USA, both quarter-finalists in 2002; Ghana, quarter-finalists in 2010; and Costa Rica, quarter-finalists in 2014. Nevertheless, European and South American teams continue to dominate, e.g., the quarter-finalists in 1994, 1998, 2006 and 2018 were all from Europe or South America and so were the finalists of all tournaments so far.\nTwo hundred teams entered the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification rounds; 198 nations attempted to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, while a record 204 countries entered qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n=== Expansion to 48 teams ===\nIn October 2013, Sepp Blatter spoke of guaranteeing the Caribbean Football Union's region a position in the World Cup. In the edition of 25 October 2013 of the FIFA Weekly Blatter wrote that: \"From a purely sporting perspective, I would like to see globalisation finally taken seriously, and the African and Asian national associations accorded the status they deserve at the FIFA World Cup. It cannot be that the European and South American confederations lay claim to the majority of the berths at the World Cup.\" Those two remarks suggested to commentators that Blatter could be putting himself forward for re-election to the FIFA Presidency.Following the magazine's publication, Blatter's would-be opponent for the FIFA Presidency, UEFA President Michel Platini, responded that he intended to extend the World Cup to 40 national associations, increasing the number of participants by eight. Platini said that he would allocate an additional berth to UEFA, two to the Asian Football Confederation and the Confederation of African Football, two shared between CONCACAF and CONMEBOL, and a guaranteed place for the Oceania Football Confederation. Platini was clear about why he wanted to expand the World Cup. He said: \"[The World Cup is] not based on the quality of the teams because you don't have the best 32 at the World Cup ... but it's a good compromise. ... It's a political matter so why not have more Africans? The competition is to bring all the people of all the world. If you don't give the possibility to participate, they don't improve.\"In October 2016, FIFA president Gianni Infantino stated his support for a 48-team World Cup in 2026. On 10 January 2017, FIFA confirmed the 2026 World Cup will have 48 finalist teams.\n\n\n=== 2015 FIFA corruption case ===\n\nBy May 2015, the games were under a particularly dark cloud because of the 2015 FIFA corruption case, allegations and criminal charges of bribery, fraud and money laundering to corrupt the issuing of media and marketing rights (rigged bids) for FIFA games, with FIFA officials accused of taking bribes totaling more than $150 million over 24 years. In late May, the U.S. Justice Department announced a 47-count indictment with charges of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy against 14 people. Arrests of over a dozen FIFA officials were made since that time, particularly on 29 May and 3 December. By the end of May 2015, a total of nine FIFA officials and five executives of sports and broadcasting markets had already been charged on corruption. At the time, FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced he would relinquish his position in February 2016.On 4 June 2015 Chuck Blazer while co-operating with the FBI and the Swiss authorities admitted that he and the other members of FIFA's then-executive committee were bribed in order to promote the 1998 and 2010 World Cups. On 10 June 2015 Swiss authorities seized computer data from the offices of Sepp Blatter. The same day, FIFA postponed the bidding process for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in light of the allegations surrounding bribery in the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments. Then-secretary general J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke stated, \"Due to the situation, I think it's nonsense to start any bidding process for the time being.\" On 28 October 2015, Blatter and FIFA VP Michel Platini, a potential candidate for presidency, were suspended for 90 days; both maintained their innocence in statements made to the news media.On 3 December 2015 two FIFA vice-presidents were arrested on suspicion of bribery in the same Zurich hotel where seven FIFA officials had been arrested in May. An additional 16 indictments by the U.S. Department of Justice were announced on the same day.\n\n\n=== Other FIFA tournaments ===\n\nAn equivalent tournament for women's football, the FIFA Women's World Cup, was first held in 1991 in China. The women's tournament is smaller in scale and profile than the men's, but is growing; the number of entrants for the 2007 tournament was 120, more than double that of 1991.Men's football has been included in every Summer Olympic Games except 1896 and 1932. Unlike many other sports, the men's football tournament at the Olympics is not a top-level tournament, and since 1992, an under-23 tournament with each team allowed three over-age players. Women's football made its Olympic debut in 1996.\nThe FIFA Confederations Cup is a tournament held one year before the World Cup at the World Cup host nation(s) as a dress rehearsal for the upcoming World Cup. It is contested by the winners of each of the six FIFA confederation championships, along with the FIFA World Cup champion and the host country.FIFA also organises international tournaments for youth football (FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup), club football (FIFA Club World Cup), and football variants such as futsal (FIFA Futsal World Cup) and beach soccer (FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup). The latter three do not have a women's version, although a FIFA Women's Club World Cup has been proposed.The FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup is held the year before each Women's World Cup and both tournaments are awarded in a single bidding process. The U-20 tournament serves as a dress rehearsal for the larger competition.\n\n\n== Trophy ==\n\nFrom 1930 to 1970, the Jules Rimet Trophy was awarded to the World Cup winning team. It was originally simply known as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president Jules Rimet who set up the first tournament. In 1970, Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983 and has never been recovered, apparently melted down by the thieves.\n\nAfter 1970, a new trophy, known as the FIFA World Cup Trophy, was designed. The experts of FIFA, coming from seven countries, evaluated the 53 presented models, finally opting for the work of the Italian designer Silvio Gazzaniga. The new trophy is 36 cm (14.2 in) high, made of solid 18 carat (75%) gold and weighs 6.175 kg (13.6 lb). The base contains two layers of semi-precious malachite while the bottom side of the trophy bears the engraved year and name of each FIFA World Cup winner since 1974. The description of the trophy by Gazzaniga was: \"The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory.\"This new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently. World Cup winners retain the trophy only until the post-match celebration is finished. They are awarded a gold-plated replica rather than the solid gold original immediately afterwards.Currently, all members (players, coaches, and managers) of the top three teams receive medals with an insignia of the World Cup Trophy; winners' (gold), runners-up' (silver), and third-place (bronze). In the 2002 edition, fourth-place medals were awarded to hosts South Korea. Before the 1978 tournament, medals were only awarded to the eleven players on the pitch at the end of the final and the third-place match. In November 2007, FIFA announced that all members of World Cup-winning squads between 1930 and 1974 were to be retroactively awarded winners' medals.\n\n\n== Format ==\n\n\n=== Qualification ===\n\nSince the second World Cup in 1934, qualifying tournaments have been held to thin the field for the final tournament. They are held within the six FIFA continental zones (Africa, Asia, North and Central America and Caribbean, South America, Oceania, and Europe), overseen by their respective confederations. For each tournament, FIFA decides the number of places awarded to each of the continental zones beforehand, generally based on the relative strength of the confederations' teams.\nThe qualification process can start as early as almost three years before the final tournament and last over a two-year period. The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations. Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental play-offs. For example, the winner of the Oceanian zone and the fifth-placed team from the Asian zone entered a play-off for a spot in the 2010 World Cup. From the 1938 World Cup onwards, host nations receive automatic qualification to the final tournament. This right was also granted to the defending champions between 1938 and 2002, but was withdrawn from the 2006 FIFA World Cup onward, requiring the champions to qualify. Brazil, winners in 2002, were the first defending champions to play qualifying matches.\n\n\n=== Final tournament ===\n\nThe current final tournament has been used since 1998 and features 32 national teams competing over the course of a month in the host nation(s). There are two stages: the group stage followed by the knockout stage.In the group stage, teams compete within eight groups of four teams each. Eight teams are seeded, including the hosts, with the other seeded teams selected using a formula based on the FIFA World Rankings and/or performances in recent World Cups, and drawn to separate groups. The other teams are assigned to different \"pots\", usually based on geographical criteria, and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups. Since 1998, constraints have been applied to the draw to ensure that no group contains more than two European teams or more than one team from any other confederation.Each group plays a round-robin tournament, in which each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group. This means that a total of six matches are played within a group. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among all four teams. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within a group. Since 1994, three points have been awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss (before, winners received two points).\nIf one considers all possible outcomes (win, draw, loss) for all six matches in a group, there are 729 (= 36) outcome combinations possible. However, 207 of these combinations lead to ties between the second and third places. In such case, the ranking among these teams is determined as follows:\nGreatest combined goal difference in all group matches\nGreatest combined number of goals scored in all group matches\nIf more than one team remain level after applying the above criteria, their ranking will be determined as follows:\nGreatest number of points in head-to-head matches among those teams\nGreatest goal difference in head-to-head matches among those teams\nGreatest number of goals scored in head-to-head matches among those teams\nFair play points, defined by the number of yellow and red cards received in the group stage:\nYellow card: minus 1 point\nIndirect red card (as a result of a second yellow card): minus 3 points\nDirect red card: minus 4 points\nYellow card and direct red card: minus 5 points\nIf any of the teams above remain level after applying the above criteria, their ranking will be determined by the drawing of lotsThe knockout stage is a single-elimination tournament in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with extra time and penalty shootouts used to decide the winner if necessary. It begins with the round of 16 (or the second round) in which the winner of each group plays against the runner-up of another group. This is followed by the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the third-place match (contested by the losing semi-finalists), and the final.On 10 January 2017, FIFA approved a new format, the 48-team World Cup (to accommodate more teams), which consists of 16 groups of three teams each, with two teams qualifying from each group, to form a round of 32 knockout stage, to be implemented by 2026.\n\n\n== Hosts ==\n\n\n=== Selection process ===\nEarly World Cups were given to countries at meetings of FIFA's congress. The locations were controversial because South America and Europe were by far the two centres of strength in football and travel between them required three weeks by boat. The decision to hold the first World Cup in Uruguay, for example, led to only four European nations competing. The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The decision to hold the second of these in France was disputed, as the South American countries understood that the location would alternate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the 1938 FIFA World Cup.Since the 1958 FIFA World Cup, to avoid future boycotts or controversy, FIFA began a pattern of alternating the hosts between the Americas and Europe, which continued until the 1998 FIFA World Cup. The 2002 FIFA World Cup, hosted jointly by South Korea and Japan, was the first one held in Asia, and the first tournament with multiple hosts. South Africa became the first African nation to host the World Cup in 2010. The 2014 FIFA World Cup was hosted by Brazil, the first held in South America since Argentina 1978, and was the first occasion where consecutive World Cups were held outside Europe.\n\nThe host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFA's Council. This is done under an exhaustive ballot system. The national football association of a country desiring to host the event receives a \"Hosting Agreement\" from FIFA, which explains the steps and requirements that are expected from a strong bid. The bidding association also receives a form, the submission of which represents the official confirmation of the candidacy. After this, a FIFA designated group of inspectors visit the country to identify that the country meets the requirements needed to host the event and a report on the country is produced. The decision on who will host the World Cup is usually made six or seven years in advance of the tournament. However, there have been occasions where the hosts of multiple future tournaments were announced at the same time, as was the case for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which were awarded to Russia and Qatar, with Qatar becoming the first Middle Eastern country to host the tournament.For the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the final tournament is rotated between confederations, allowing only countries from the chosen confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) to bid to host the tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the controversy surrounding Germany's victory over South Africa in the vote to host the 2006 tournament. However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from 2018. This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.The 2026 FIFA World Cup was chosen to be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico, marking the first time a World Cup has been shared by three host nations. The 2026 tournament will be the biggest World Cup ever held, with 48 teams playing 80 matches. Sixty matches will take place in the US, including all matches from the quarter-finals onward, while Canada and Mexico will host 10 games each.\n\n\n=== Performances ===\n\nSix of the eight champions have won one of their titles while playing in their own homeland, the exceptions being Brazil, who finished as runners-up after losing the deciding match on home soil in 1950 and lost their semi-final against Germany in 2014, and Spain, which reached the second round on home soil in 1982. England (1966) won its only title while playing as a host nation. Uruguay (1930), Italy (1934), Argentina (1978) and \nFrance (1998) won their first titles as host nations but have gone on to win again, while Germany (1974) won their second title on home soil.Other nations have also been successful when hosting the tournament. Switzerland (quarter-finals 1954), Sweden (runners-up in 1958), Chile (third place in 1962), South Korea (fourth place in 2002), and Mexico (quarter-finals in 1970 and 1986) all have their best results when serving as hosts. So far, South Africa (2010) has been the only host nation to fail to advance beyond the first round.\n\n\n== Attendance ==\n\n The best-attended single match, shown in the last three columns, has been the final in half of the 20 World Cups as of  2014. Another match or matches drew more attendance than the final in 1930, 1938, 1958, 1962, 1970\u20131982, 1990 and 2006.\n\nSource: FIFA\n\n\n== Broadcasting and promotion ==\n\nThe World Cup was first televised in 1954 and is now the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world. The cumulative viewership of all matches of the 2006 World Cup is estimated to be 26.29 billion. 715.1 million individuals watched the final match of this tournament (a ninth of the entire population of the planet). The 2006 World Cup draw, which decided the distribution of teams into groups, was watched by 300 million viewers. The World Cup attracts many sponsors such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Adidas. For these companies and many more, being a sponsor strongly impacts their global brands. Host countries typically experience a multimillion-dollar revenue increase from the month-long event.\nThe governing body of the sport, FIFA, generated $4.8 billion in revenue from the 2014 tournament.Each FIFA World Cup since 1966 has its own mascot or logo. World Cup Willie, the mascot for the 1966 competition, was the first World Cup mascot. World Cups feature official match balls specially designed for each tournament. Each World Cup also has an official song, which have been performed by artists ranging from Shakira to Will Smith. Other songs, such as \u201cNessun dorma\u201d, performed by The Three Tenors at four World Cup concerts, have also become identified with the tournament.Forming a partnership with FIFA in 1970, Panini published its first sticker album for the 1970 World Cup. Since then, collecting and trading stickers has become part of the World Cup experience, especially for the younger generation. FIFA has also licensed World Cup video games since 1986, with Electronic Arts the current license holder.The World Cup even has a statistically significant effect on birth rates, the male/female sex ratio of newborns, and heart attacks in nations whose national teams are competing.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\na.e.t.: after extra time\npen.: after penalty shoot-out\nTBD: to be determinedNotes\nIn all, 79 nations have played in at least one World Cup. Of these, eight national teams have won the World Cup, and they have added stars to their badges, with each star representing a World Cup victory. (Uruguay, however, choose to display four stars on their badge, representing their two gold medals at the 1924 and 1928 Summer Olympics and their two World Cup titles in 1930 and 1950).\nWith five titles, Brazil are the most successful World Cup team and also the only nation to have played in every World Cup (21) to date. Brazil were also the first team to win the World Cup for the third (1970), fourth (1994) and fifth (2002) time. Italy (1934 and 1938) and Brazil (1958 and 1962) are the only nations to have won consecutive titles. West Germany (1982\u20131990) and Brazil (1994\u20132002) are the only nations to appear in three consecutive World Cup finals. Germany has made the most top-four finishes (13), medals (12), as well as the most finals (8).\n\n\n=== Teams reaching the top four ===\n\n\n=== Best performances by continental zones ===\n\nTo date, the final of the World Cup has only been contested by teams from the UEFA (Europe) and CONMEBOL (South America) confederations. European nations have won twelve titles, while South American have won nine. Only two teams from outside these two continents have ever reached the semi-finals of the competition: United States (North, Central America and Caribbean) in 1930 and South Korea (Asia) in 2002. The best result of an African team is reaching the quarter-finals: Cameroon in 1990, Senegal in 2002 and Ghana in 2010. Only one Oceanian qualifier, Australia in 2006, has advanced to the second round.Brazil, Argentina, Spain and Germany are the only teams to win a World Cup outside their continental confederation; Brazil came out victorious in Europe (1958), North America (1970 and 1994) and Asia (2002). Argentina won a World Cup in North America in 1986, while Spain won in Africa in 2010. In 2014, Germany became the first European team to win in the Americas. Only on five occasions have consecutive World Cups been won by teams from the same continent, and currently it is the first time with four champions in a row from the same continental confederation. Italy and Brazil successfully defended their titles in 1938 and 1962 respectively, while Italy's triumph in 2006 has been followed by wins for Spain in 2010, Germany in 2014 and France in 2018. Currently, it is also the first time that one of the currently winning continents (Europe) is ahead of the other (South America) by more than one championship.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\nAt the end of each World Cup, awards are presented to the players and teams for accomplishments other than their final team positions in the tournament. There are currently six awards:\nThe Golden Ball for the best player, determined by a vote of media members (first awarded in 1982); the Silver Ball and the Bronze Ball are awarded to the players finishing second and third in the voting respectively;\nThe Golden Boot (sometimes called the Golden Shoe) for the top goalscorer (first awarded in 1982, but retrospectively applied to all tournaments from 1930); most recently, the Silver Boot and the Bronze Boot have been awarded to the second and third top goalscorers respectively;\nThe Golden Glove Award (formerly the Yashin Award) for the best goalkeeper, decided by the FIFA Technical Study Group (first awarded in 1994);\nThe Best Young Player Award for the best player aged 21 or younger at the start of the calendar year, decided by the FIFA Technical Study Group (first awarded in 2006);\nThe FIFA Fair Play Trophy for the team with the best record of fair play, according to the points system and criteria established by the FIFA Fair Play Committee (first awarded in 1978);\nThe Most Entertaining Team for the team that has entertained the public the most during the World Cup, determined by a poll of the general public (first awarded in 1994);An All-Star Team consisting of the best players of the tournament has also been announced for each tournament since 1998.\n\n\n== Records and statistics ==\n\nThree players share the record for playing in the most World Cups; Mexico's Antonio Carbajal (1950\u20131966) and Rafael M\u00e1rquez (2002\u20132018); and Germany's Lothar Matth\u00e4us (1982\u20131998) all played in five tournaments. Matth\u00e4us has played the most World Cup matches overall, with 25 appearances. Brazil's Djalma Santos (1954\u20131962), West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer (1966\u20131974) and Germany's Philipp Lahm (2006\u20132014) are the only players to be named to three Finals All-Star Teams.Miroslav Klose of Germany (2002\u20132014) is the all-time top scorer at the finals, with 16 goals. He broke Ronaldo of Brazil's record of 15 goals (1998\u20132006) during the 2014 semi-final match against Brazil. West Germany's Gerd M\u00fcller (1970\u20131974) is third, with 14 goals. The fourth placed goalscorer, France's Just Fontaine, holds the record for the most goals scored in a single World Cup; all his 13 goals were scored in the 1958 tournament.In November 2007, FIFA announced that all members of World Cup-winning squads between 1930 and 1974 were to be retroactively awarded winners' medals. This made Brazil's Pel\u00e9 the only player to have won three World Cup winners' medals (1958, 1962, and 1970, although he did not play in the 1962 final due to injury), with 20 other players who have won two winners' medals. Seven players have collected all three types of World Cup medals (winners', runner- ups', and third-place); five players were from West Germany's squad of 1966\u20131974 including Franz Beckenbauer, J\u00fcrgen Grabowski, Horst-Dieter H\u00f6ttges, Sepp Maier and Wolfgang Overath (1966\u20131974), Italy's Franco Baresi (1982, 1990, 1994) and the most recent has been Miroslav Klose of Germany (2002\u20132014) with four consecutive medals.Brazil's M\u00e1rio Zagallo, West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer and France's Didier Deschamps are the only people to date to win the World Cup as both player and head coach. Zagallo won in 1958 and 1962 as a player and in 1970 as head coach. Beckenbauer won in 1974 as captain and in 1990 as head coach, and Deschamps repeated the feat in 2018, after having won in 1998 as captain. Italy's Vittorio Pozzo is the only head coach to ever win two World Cups (1934 and 1938). All World Cup-winning head coaches were natives of the country they coached to victory.Among the national teams, Germany and Brazil have played the most World Cup matches (109), Germany appeared in the most finals (8), semi-finals (13), quarter-finals (16), while Brazil has appeared in the most World Cups (21), has the most wins (73) and has scored the most goals (229).

He published only two novels in his lifetime; although they were separated by a quarter of a century, both were released to considerable critical acclaim. He died while on his weekly ramble with his friends, from his home in the village of Castleton on the North York Moors.\nRushforth was born in Gateshead in County Durham, but was raised in Leeds. He studied English at Hull University. After completing a teacher's training course at Nottingham, he became a full-time school teacher. He taught English for four years in Huddersfield, before joining Friends' School in Great Ayton, North Yorkshire. In due course, he would become Head of English at this school.\nHis first novel Kindergarten was published in 1979. Kindled by Rushforth's interest in the Holocaust, and in particular his discovery of a cache of pre-war letters from Jewish parents pleading for their children's safe passage, Kindergarten was a short and disturbing novel, a grim reworking of the fable of Hansel and Gretel from the canon of the Brothers Grimm. The book was hailed on both sides of the Atlantic. It received rave reviews in The New York Times, The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, while in Britain, it won the Hawthornden Prize, the oldest literary award in the UK. The Hawthornden, awarded annually for the \"best work of imaginative literature\", was particularly appropriate for the non-Jewish Rushforth who had written persuasively about the Holocaust.\nThe book then went out of print, and Rushforth was not to publish another novel for 25 years. Although he enjoyed teaching, it was a demanding job and he struggled to make time for his writing. In 1994, his friends took him on a trip to Brazil, and as Rushforth put it, \"left me on a mountain for a month with nothing to do but write\". A rough draft of 28,000 words came out of this enforced holiday. The following year, he quit his teaching job to concentrate full-time on his writing.\nRushforth's meticulous craftsmanship meant that he did not produce a final version of his second novel until 2002; it had taken him 15 drafts to get there. Pinkerton's Sister (2004), a vast and dense novel, over 700 pages compressed into a single day, described the fantastic inner life of Alice Pinkerton, a brilliant spinster who is regarded as somewhat crazy by the turn-of-the-century New York City society around her, but who lives in her own, richly-detailed world of literature, fertile with allusions to Shakespeare, Wilde, Poe, Whitman, Stevenson, Tennyson, Austen, and many others. This book too was hailed by literary critics. Its subject matter and style \u2013 stream-of-consciousness narrative over a single day, packed with literary references, and producing a panoramic portrait of a society \u2013 even led some critics to draw parallels to James Joyce's great novel Ulysses.\nRushforth died just as his literary career was about to take off. His third novel, a follow-up to Pinkerton's Sister under the title A Dead Language, was published in the spring of 2006. Though Rushforth had planned three more novels after that, on a Sunday in September 2005; he had been walking on Blakey Ridge in the North Yorkshire Moors with his regular walking group when he suffered a heart attack.\n\n\n== External links ==\nDetails of life and work\n\"A Review of Peter Rushforth's A Dead Language\", by Christine Lagorio, a 2007 review of Rushforth's last novel in The Believer\nArchival Material at Leeds University Library", "Lachlan Duff Gordon-Duff (1 June 1817 \u2013 10 January 1892) was a British politician.

Less often, the columns may be based on the difference between the combatants' strengths, rather than the ratio (for example '3', if an attacker with strength 5 attacks a defender with strength 2).\nA die roll is then made using one or more dice and the resulting number is then cross-referenced on the table to find the results of the individual clash. \nGame conditions can influence the strength numbers used to calculate the ratio in the form of doubling or halving each of them, in addition to column shifts that can occur due to terrain, weather or some other factor. Typical results include elimination, advances or retreats, surrender, casualty reduction, or partial losses.\nFor example, the simple Combat Results Table (CRT) included in this article could be interpreted as follows:\n\nAE: Attacking unit(s) completely Eliminated\nDE: Defending unit(s) completely Eliminated\nIntermediate results (reflected by a slash separating two values): the number to the left of the slash represents the losses suffered by the attacking force, the number to the right of the slash represents the losses the defenders might suffer (losses may result in the dissolution or destruction of sub-units and/or the overall distance a force may retreat).  A dash represents no effect to the force indicated.The brackets seen in the results running diagonally from the lower left hand corner of the chart to the upper right hand corner could indicate some additional outcome such as melee or continuing engagement that involves both sides.  The asterisk shown in some results might represent a supplementary outcome that influences only the defender, such as a mandatory retreat.

It is considered by the Italian government and Prefecture of Venice as including all the characteristics of Article 416 bis-cp, the legislative definition of a mafia-type organisation with Mafia (Cosa Nostra, 'Ndrangheta, Camorra) affiliations within Italy.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, a number of high-ranking members of the Sicilian Mafia were sent in solitary confinement in various provincial towns in the Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia regions; mostly around the cities of Vicenza, Padua, Trieste and Venice, in an attempt to isolate powerful Sicilian ringleaders from other members in the Mafia.\nThe most notable Sicilian mafiosi included: Salvatore Contorno, Gaetano Fidanzati, Antonino Duca and Gaetano and Salvatore Badalamenti, and Giuseppe Madonia.[1] Veneti malavitosi, or underworld figures and bandits from the Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, began to seek contact with these Sicilian criminals and eventually organized themselves, obtaining enough power to take the reins of the organization. What started as a small gang of criminals controlling racketeering along the Riviera del Brenta between Padua and Venice, became an international syndicate under the \"boss\" Felice Maniero.\n\n\n== Criminal panorama of Veneto ==\nBefore the arrival of these high-calibre Sicilian mobsters, Veneto's crime problem was restricted to various disorganised gangs operating throughout the region. In the 1980s, just before the emergence of the Mala del Brenta, there were already a few organized crime syndicates that would later be incorporated under the central authority of the Mala del Brenta.\nThese organizations included:\n\n\"Clan Giostrai\" -- various affiliated groups of nomad criminals, mostly from the provinces of Vicenza, Padova and Venice, of whom a number had a relation to the carnival fair businesses. These were involved in bank heists, robberies, the drug trade, and kidnapping for ransom.\nThe \"Mestrini\" group, based in Mestre, on the immediate Venetian mainland:  a powerful group with strong ties to the Mala del Brenta, their most lucrative trade was drug trafficking, but the group was involved in a vast array of criminal enterprises. Most notably, the ownership of many abusive water taxis that would bring foreign tourists to shops and hotels in Venice that were owned by the clans associates. The \"zoccolo duro\" or top capos of the organisation were: Gino Causin, Gilberto \"Lolli\" Boatto, Paolo Tenderini, Roberto \"Paja\" Paggiarin and Paolo Pattarello.\nThe \"Veneziani\", the old criminal underworld of Venice, engaged in the same activities of the \"Mestrini\":  the group was headed by the Rizzi brothers and Giancarlo Millo, nicknamed \"The Martian\".\nThe San Don\u00e0 di Piave cartel, under the leadership of Silvano Maritan, nicknamed \"The President\", prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the confined Cosa Nostra boss Salvatore Contorno, the rivalry with another cartel based in the same area caused a number of violent confrontations and subsequently placed Maritan as capo of the eastern part of the province of Venice, that is until he gave up a percentage of his assets to Felice Maniero.\n\n\n== Life of Maniero ==\nManiero was born in the impoverished village of Campolongo Maggiore in Venice, where he started his own crew of local gangsters, composed of family members and childhood friends that would later hold the reins of his criminal empire. While becoming a major criminal presence in the area, he was befriended by a number of prominent Sicilian mafiosi who backed him up in his vision of uniting Veneto organised crime.\nManiero's establishment subsequently controlled all criminal ventures in the region; all other organised crime groups in the region had been subjugated by the group originating from Campolongo Maggiore and backed up by the Sicilians and also members of the Camorra. All except the exponents of the \"Veneziani\" clan, the Rizzi brothers, were feeling menaced by the mainland syndicates under Maniero, but the other \"Veneziano\" capo Millo, was a personal friend of Maniero, and preferred collaborating with \"Angel Face\" and his allies.\nWhile dining at a restaurant, Millo was shot and killed on March 17, 1990 by the Rizzi brothers, a violent feud ensued, between the Mala del Brenta and the \"Veneziani\", after six months, the Rizzi brothers and an associate were treacherously murdered in an ambush disguised as a meeting to discuss peace terms, Maniero placed Giovanni Giada as head of the Mala del Brenta in the Venetian lagoon. He was now in firm control of all Veneto.\n\n\n== Affiliations and criminal activity ==\nThe organisation has had a number of high-level political connections outside Italy (Croatia and Yugoslavia, Malta, Hungary and  Austria). At one point, Maniero was a personal friend of the son of the former Croatian president Franjo Tu\u0111man and was involved in the supply of guns to Croatia, in the early 1990s.The organisation had a firm hold of nearly every criminal venture in the region, from money laundering to loansharking and extortion, but its major source of income was drug dealing; the group bought massive amount of cocaine directly from the Sicilian and Colombian Mafia, as well as heroin from Turkish drug baron Nvo Berisa, who helped a number of Venetian mobsters in hiding in Turkey, including Felice Maniero and Antonio Pandolfo, the group's second in command.\nIts members are exclusively native to the Veneto region, but with a number of associates operating in the region from Cosa Nostra, Camorra and it is believed from the Ndrangheta as well. It is also known that Brenta mafiosi have colluded with Stidda members on a number of occasions involving a number of fraudulent scams at a Maltese casino in 2002.\n\n\n=== Downfall ===\nThe organisation was thought to be dismantled in late 1994, due to revelations that the former boss Maniero was captured by a task force of 400 policemen issued with the sole task of bringing Maniero and his associates down. After being arrested in Turin in 1993 (having previously evaded the Padua and Vicenza prisons) together with many of the top members of the syndicate.\nManiero, faced with life imprisonment, turned informant, helping the Italian police dismantle the organisation he himself had created, contributing to the arrest of more than 400 of the mob's members, as well as a number of judges, policemen, and local Venetian businessmen that had aligned themselves with the organisation.\nAlthough it has been revealed that Maniero continued a number of criminal activities and many of his former henchmen re-organised the Mala del Brenta to ensure survival, it is now called Nuova Mala del Brenta or Nuova Mafia Veneta and it still influences many criminal ventures in the region, ranging from robberies and bank heists to arms and drug trafficking.\n\n\n== Recent years ==\nIn August 1996, the members of the re-instated gang, coordinated a spectacularly successful heist at the \"Mirabilandia\" theme park securing 350 billion lira in an attempt to get the group back on its feet after the revelations of Maniero and other turncoats\nIn May 2005, Francesco Tonicello a member of the old Mala del Brenta, was arrested in London after having been on the run for a number of years as one of Italy's most wanted men. A master forger, he worked under 11 aliases and fenced priceless artworks, antiques and gold for Venetian godfather \"Angel Face\" Maniero, as well as participating in a brutal double homicide.\nIn April 2005, the carabinieri kill Luigi Quatela a top member of the syndicate in Chiampo, in the province of Vicenza\nIn August 2006, the massive \"Ghost Dog\" operation undergoes, Italian police arrest over 60 exponents of the criminal organization, including policemen on the group's payroll. After two years of investigation, and the precious reveletians of the turncoats Stefano Galletto and Giuseppe Pastore, police deal a severe blow to the organisation, arresting local gang leaders in the provinces of Venice, Padua, Vicenza and Verona, most notably Achille Pozzi, from Padua, and Giorgio Fontana from Vicenza, together with their respective henchmen.\nIn July 2007, the Carabinieri busted a criminal group composed of ex Mala del Brenta associates and nomad criminals from the province of Vicenza, they were trying to form a new group made up of the older elit\u00e8 members of mala del Brenta who had escaped or finished prison sentences and Vicenza and Bassano criminals engaging in drug trade and robberies, the group had been responsible for five gangland killings in the last three months, but turncoat Maich Gabrielli  helped dismantle the group after witnessing the murder of 26-year-old cousin Emanuele Crovi.\nIn August 2007, a seventeen-year-old Tunisian boy was kidnapped as a result of hostilities between immigrant drug dealers.\nBeaten and held hostage for several days in Padua's periphery, his kidnappers were two Albanians and an Italian slightly older than he was. When the Carabinieri came to liberate the hostage a gunfight ensued, with a Carabiniere remaining wounded, the juvenile criminals succeeded in escaping in a car whose number plates belonged to  a capo of the Nuova Mala del Brenta, when the Carabinieri deepened their investigation into the incident, they uncovered a series of a new alliances between the syndicate and a number of immigrant youth gangs present in the city of Padua.\nIn October 2007, Italian police arrest Ercole Salvan, member of the syndicate, and one of the most feared bandits of the region, hailing from Cittadella (Padova), he had been on the run since the murder of a truck driver during a highway robbery.\nIn November 2007, a task force of about a hundred Italian and Spanish policemen, interrupt a steady flow of cocaine, from South America via Spain to North-Eastern Italy controlled by one of the organisations top members, the infamous Silvano Maritan, head of the San Don\u00e0 di Piave cartel, already one of the head figures in the \"old\" mala del Brenta. After exiting prison in 2001, he took control of the drug trade in eastern Veneto, supplying cocaine in a number of discos all along the Venetian coastal resorts.\nIn May 2008, Italian investigators uncovered a plan to free bosses Lucio Calabresi and Mariano Magro from their prison in Vicenza. The man who intended to do this was Rafaele Vassallo, the plan was to subsequently murder a judge, two police captains, turncoat Stefano Galletto and his family and finally Felice Maniero in a series of terrorist attacks to be carried out with explosives and rocket launchers. A warehouse full of armaments was found in Padua's industrial area, and the would-be ideators of the plan were arrested.\nIn November 2008, the Carabinieri busted an unusual criminal join-venture made of former Far Right and Far Left terrorists, associates of the old Milan organized crime and Nuova Mala associates, above all Fiorenzo Trincanato, once one of Felice Maniero's enforcers. This group is believed to be involved with drug trafficking in the Northern Italy, controlling cocaine trade from Veneto to Liguria.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nDianese, Maurizio \u00a9 1995 Il bandito Felice Maniero, il Cardo editore Venice.\nManiero, Felice \u00a9 (with Pasqualetto, Andrea \u00a9) Una vita criminale, Marsilio Editore.\nZornetta, Monica & Guerretta, Danilo \u00a9 2006 A casa nostra: Cinquant'anni di mafia e criminalit\u00e0 in Veneto Edito da Baldini Castoldi Dalai, ISBN 88-8490-586-9 [2]\nFelice Maniero, Italian Wiki article\nMala del Brenta, Italian Wiki article\nLa Nuova Mala del Brenta\nBlitz against the \"Nuova Mala del Brenta\" (Corriere della Sera - Jan. 2006)\nArticolo 416 bis-c.p.: Mafia e associazione, una realt\u00e0[3]https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2010/10/10/x-factor-hopeful-nicolo-festa-in-link-to-mafia-boss-115875-22622726/", "Great Canadian Heli-Skiing is a heliskiing operator that provides strong intermediate and advanced skiers and snowboarders access to the British Columbia backcountry.

The company operates in winter from Heather Mountain Lodge, located between the mountain towns of Golden and Revelstoke.\n\n\n== History ==\nGreat Canadian Heli-Skiing first started operation in 1986 by former owner Wayne Bingham. Bingham, previously employed at a large heli-skiing operation, was convinced that starting a heli-skiing operation that skied only in small groups instead of the large groups that was the industry norm, would instantly move the entire industry to a new level and be very popular with heliski clients. Great Canadian Heli-Skiing became the first operation to adopt the small group format on all tours. This move revolutionized the industry, leading to a demand for small group heli-skiing. Every new heliski company in Canada has used the small group format exclusively since that time.\nThe company once again become an industry leader in 2006, when it was the first to include \"Unlimited Vertical\" on all tours. Most heli-skiing operations guarantee a set amount of vertical skied. If this amount is met, many heliskiing operations will charge for extra vertical skied. Those companies that do not charge for extra vertical refer to this as \"Unlimited Vertical\".\nThe creation of the format of heli-skiing in small groups, Unlimited Vertical and with companies that are usually family or non-corporate owned, lead to the term \"Boutique Heli-Skiing\". This term was first coined in 2003 in the Denver Post by Greg Porter, current owner of Great Canadian Heli-Skiing.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGreat Canadian Heli-Skiing\nGreat Canadian Heli-Skiing (German)", "Wijnkoop is a Dutch surname.\nPeople with the name Wijnkoop include:\n\nDavid Wijnkoop - Communist foreman and Member of Parliament\nJoseph Wijnkoop - Biblical scholar and Rabbi, father of David", "Clockwork Angels is the nineteenth and final studio album by Canadian rock band Rush, released on 8 June 2012 on Anthem Records. During their year-and-a-half break following their Snakes & Arrows Tour, the group decided to write a new studio album. The album was recorded in April 2010 at Blackbird Studio in Nashville, Tennessee and from October to December 2011 at Revolution Recording in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.Two songs that would eventually appear on the album, \"Caravan\" and \"BU2B\", were released to radio stations and made available as a digital download on 1 June 2010.  Following the release of these two songs, the band embarked on the Time Machine Tour, with \"Caravan\" and \"BU2B\" included in the set list. Clockwork Angels was completed following this tour. The album's second single, titled \"Headlong Flight\", was released on 19 April 2012. The album's third single, \"The Wreckers\", was released on 25 July 2012. On 20 February 2013, \"The Anarchist\" was released as the fourth and final single. A 10\" picture disc version of the song \"The Garden\" was released as part of the 2013 Record Store Day Black Friday sale, limited to 3,000 copies.\nThe album debuted at No. 1 in Canada and at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart. The album won the award for Rock Album of the Year at the 2013 Juno Awards.\n\n\n== Background and writing ==\nAt the end of their Snakes & Arrows Tour in July 2008 the group took a year-and-a-half long break, during which they released the live albums Snakes & Arrows Live (2008) and the compilation Working Men (2009). The band reconvened in Los Angeles in December 2009 to discuss what projects they wanted to undertake in the coming year. Among their options were to start a new studio album and to undergo a major tour; as Peart later wrote: \"Fools that we are, we ended up doing both.\" The idea of an album with a back story as opposed to a collection of different songs became an attractive one to the group, for which Peart detailed one set in a fictional world with a suite of songs telling a story. Rush had worked on new material as early as February 2009, but Lifeson denied a speculation that they were set to make a concept album at that time.Rush adopted their usual songwriting methods which involved Lee and Lifeson working on the music at their home studios in Toronto while Peart worked alone from his California home on the lyrics. The group had encouraged one another to become more spontaneous with their solos in live performance which became a primary element while writing new music for Clockwork Angels. Lifeson had to consciously hold himself back from layering guitar tracks as he wanted to emphasise the \"basic rockiness of the songs\" and resorted to greater use of double tracking. The sessions were productive; in March 2010, Lee said: \"Just about a month and a half ago we had no songs. And now we've been writing and now we've got about six songs that we just love\" and Lifeson predicted a spring 2011 release.After some weeks into the writing Peart had developed his story further, leading to the band's agreement to adapt it into concept album while having each track make its own statement. Rush had previously recorded conceptual songs throughout the career, but had yet to commit to a full album concept. Lee was apprehensive towards the idea at first as he wanted the group to move forward in direction and not adopt something typical of fellow progressive rock bands of the 1970s. Music Radar wrote that despite the story-based theme, the album fails to get weighed down by the plot. In a change of pace, Peart wrote the lyrics to Clockwork Angels on a blank canvas without using any preconceived ideas that he had written down. Early in January 2010, Peart had written some ideas and sent them to Lee and Lifeson, who then paired the words to the pieces of music that they had come up with. Peart was influenced to devise a story and lyrics set it in a dystopian steampunk-inspired world \"lit only by fire\", named after the same-titled book on the history of the Middle Ages by William Manchester and \"driven by steam, intricate clockworks, and alchemy\". He had incorporated elements of ancient tradition with Tarot cards on Vapor Trails (2002) and the ancient Hindi game Leela on Snakes & Arrows and wanted to bring in alchemy for Clockwork Angels. Peart wrote a lyrical \"chapter\" for each of the album's twelve tracks, representing the mood or atmosphere of each track with its own symbol as depicted in the artwork. The plot is based on various sources such as Candide by Voltaire \"with nods to\" the novel The Sot-Weed Factor (1960) by John Barth and writers Michael Ondaatje, Joseph Conrad, Robertson Davies, Herbert Gold, Daphne du Maurier, and Cormac McCarthy, and early Spanish explorers in the American Southwest for the Seven Cities of Gold myth.Development paused in April 2010 when Rush announced their Time Machine Tour which was initially set to run from June to October of that year. The tour saw Rush perform two new songs that they had written for Clockwork Angels entitled \"Caravan\" and \"BU2B\". They had also written \"The Garden\" and \"The Anarchist\" at that point. With the first half of the Time Machine Tour finished, Lee and Lifeson resumed to write the rest of the album in early 2011, but the sessions had not produced strong enough results barring from some \"furious jams\" that became the basis of \"Carnies\" and \"Headlong Flight\". There was also difficulty in matching Peart's lyrics to the new music which resulted in many rewrites, some on the day of recording via e-mail. Lifeson later complimented Peart: \"Neil came through \u2013 he never complained\".In August 2010, Lifeson had remarked at the time that the album was turning out to be very musically diverse. In particular, Lifeson referred to the nearly finished title track \"Clockwork Angels\" as an \"epic song\" and a \"multi-parted piece\". He described it as \"very dynamic\". Peart said of the still in-work album in May 2011, \"I intend it to be my highest achievement lyrically and drumming wise.\" When the final writing sessions began in late 2011, Lee and Lifeson decided to swap instruments at one particular meeting. The result was what became \"The Wreckers\".Clockwork Angels contains string arrangements composed of six violins and two cellos. Brad Madix stated when working the strings in the album: \"I'd worked with strings in the past, but it was always either in a very quiet setting with minimal sound reinforcement or the violins were strictly electric. On Rush's Clockwork Angels Tour, the band definitely meant for the strings to be featured and acoustic.\"\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Recording ===\nRush recorded Clockwork Angels in two phases. The first took place in April 2010 at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee with Nick Raskulinecz returning as co-producer following his work on Snakes & Arrows (2007). The tracks \"Caravan\" and \"BU2B\" were recorded during this time and mixing was completed by Richard Chycki at the Sound Kitchen in Franklin, Tennessee. The band's initial plan was to return to the studio at the conclusion of the Time Machine Tour in October 2010 and have the album finished for a 2011 release. However, they decided to extend the tour with dates from March to July 2011, thus pushing back the release of Clockwork Angels. That August, the band announced their deal with Roadrunner Records in partnership with their domestic label Anthem Records to handle their international distribution, marking the end of their time with Atlantic Records which began with Presto (1989).The second phase of recording took place at Revolution Recording in Toronto between October and December 2011. The strings were recorded at Ocean Way Recording in Los Angeles in January 2012.On his personal website, Peart revealed that he took a new approach in writing and recording his drum tracks for the album: \"I played through each song just a few times on my own, checking out patterns and fills that might work, then called in Booujzhe. He stood in the room with me, facing my drums, with a music stand and a single drumstick\u2014he was my conductor, and I was his orchestra ... I would attack the drums, responding to his enthusiasm, and his suggestions between takes, and together we would hammer out the basic architecture of the part. His baton would conduct me into choruses, half-time bridges, and double-time outros and so on\u2014so I didn't have to worry about their durations. No counting, and no endless repetition.\"\n\n\n=== Novel ===\nOn 9 February 2012, science fiction novelist Kevin J. Anderson, a long time friend of Neil Peart, announced that he would be writing a novelization of Clockwork Angels. He also revealed information about the album's concept:\nIn a young man's quest to follow his dreams, he is caught between the grandiose forces of order and chaos. He travels across a lavish and colorful world of steampunk and alchemy, with lost cities, pirates, anarchists, exotic carnivals, and a rigid Watchmaker who imposes precision on every aspect of daily life.\n\nReleased on 4 September 2012, the novel was followed by a loose sequel titled Clockwork Lives, which was published on 15 September 2015.\n\n\n=== Artwork ===\nThe album's front cover, designed by Rush's longtime collaborator Hugh Syme, depicts a clock marked with alchemical symbols instead of numbers. It displays the time as 9:12, which in 24-hour time is 21:12, a reference to the band's fourth studio album, 2112 (1976).\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\nClockwork Angels was released on 8 June 2012 in Australia, followed by the United States and Canada on 12 June and in Europe on 13 June. British magazine Classic Rock released a limited edition fan pack containing the album and 132-page magazine on 11 June.The single \"Caravan\" was released 1 June 2010 to radio stations and made available for digital download at this time along with \"BU2B\". The second single, \"Headlong Flight\", was released to radio stations and for online streaming on 19 April 2012.\nThe album debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 with sales of 103,000 units the first week. In Canada, the album debuted at No. 1 with sales of 20,000 units. By 20 June, over 40,000 copies of the Classic Rock fan pack had been sold. Had the release been eligible for the UK Albums Chart, the album would have debuted at No. 1. As more people bought the fan pack than the album alone, the latter debuted at No. 76 in the UK before it reached its peak at No. 21.Clockwork Angels holds a score of 74 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 14 reviews, which indicates \"generally favourable reviews\". Classic Rock scored the album a 9/10 and called it Rush's best release in 30 years. Jamie Thompson of The Guardian wrote in his review that \"those who worship at the temple of Rush will be in raptures; for those who remain agnostic, there may well be enough here to justify a leap of faith.\" Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles editor-in-chief Martin Popoff gave the album a perfect 10/10 and said of it, \"one can't deny that there's more purpose and focus here than on any Rush album ever\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll lyrics written by Neil Peart; all music composed by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\nRush\n\nGeddy Lee \u2013 bass guitar, bass pedals, lead vocals, synthesizers\nAlex Lifeson \u2013 guitars (electric, acoustic & 12-string), additional keyboards\nNeil Peart \u2013 drums, percussionAdditional musicians\n\nDavid Campbell \u2013 String arrangement & conducting\nJason Sniderman \u2013 Piano on \"The Garden\"Production\n\nArranged & produced by Rush & Nick Raskulinecz\nRecording engineers: Richard Chycki, Martin Cooke, Jason DuFour, Paul Fig & Stephen Koszler\nMixed by Nick Raskulinecz\nMastered by Brian Gardner\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==", "Golic and Wingo is an American sports-talk radio show that is hosted by Mike Golic, Sr., his son Mike Jr. and  Trey Wingo airing on the  ESPN networks.

Peiris was educated at Colombo Academy (now Royal College, Colombo) where he excelled in studies winning the Turnour Prize and the Shakespeare prize. He won the English University Scholarship in 1877 and proceeded to St John's College, Cambridge at the University of Cambridge. At Cambridge he had the rare distinction of obtaining a double first \u2013 a first class in the Law Tripos and a first class in the Moral Science Tripos. There he was the first non-European to be elected President of the Cambridge Union in 1882. Peiris was called to Bar at Lincoln's Inn in England thus becoming a barrister. He refused to join the Ceylon Civil Service and instead started a law practice. In 1902 he accepted for a short time the office of District Judge of Galle. As a lawyer he played a pioneering role in constitutional reform.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 1892, as President of the Ceylon National Association (founded by Sir Charles Henry de Soysa), Peiris led the campaign to abolish the 'paddy (grain) tax', for which he was recognised by the Cobden Club. It was the first instance that the tax was abolished in the recorded history of the island. Peiris's entry into politics was as a Member of the Colombo Municipal Council from 1898 to 1908 representing the Slave Island ward, and served on the Public Works Council. Though a reluctant politician at first, Peiris initiated constitutional reforms such as the abolition of the then system of racial representation and the introduction of the elective principle in place of nomination.In 1915 Peiris led the campaign for a Royal Commission of Inquiry and the vindication of the reputations of those who had been falsely accused during the riots of 1915. Peiris was the chairman of the committee which was protesting the British Governor's handling of the riots and the unfair and discriminative treatment being meted out to Sinhala Buddhist leaders. As a Christian, although he was offered privileges and pressured by the ruling British, he fearlessly refused them and stuck to his principles. Seeing the horror unleashed by the governor and his advisers, he initiated and drafted a memorandum in great secrecy supported by other prominent members of society to bring it to the attention of the King and His Majesty's Government. It was taken to England hidden in the sole of a shoe by E. W. Perera. As a result of this the governor Sir Robert Chalmers was recalled.In 1920 Peiris was elected President of the Ceylon National Congress staunchly supported by D.S. Senanayake and F.R. Senanayake. Forming the Congress was a self-sacrificing effort by Peiris and the National Association, up until that time the most powerful lobby in Ceylon. He continued the struggle for reforms and promoted greater representation of natives in the government bureaucracy and the judiciary. He also campaigned to abolish the poll tax.There was wide support for Peiris' nomination to the Legislative Council of Ceylon. On two occasions when nominations had to be made for the position of \"an educated Ceylonese\" James Peiris was passed over, notwithstanding his ability and integrity. Peiris also was opposed to the principle of nomination. Immediately the elective principle was introduced into the Legislative Council, Peiris was elected unopposed. At the same election his brother-in-law Sir Henry De Mel was also elected unopposed, on behalf of the Low Country Products Association. In 1922 Peiris led the fight against the Supply Bill which sought to increase taxation and led a walkout from the Legislative Council in protest.In 1924 the legislative council was reconstituted with a majority of elected representatives. Peiris was elected as Vice-President \u2013 a position he held until his death in 1930. The post of President was held nominally by the Governor and Peiris presided over the Council and acted as Officer Administering the Government. Peiris accepted in 1925 a knighthood from the King and was a Justice of the Peace for the whole island. He was the first Ceylonese occupant of Queens House as Acting-Governor.Peiris was first to propose the creation of a University College in Colombo and the means of financing it. Following the establishment of the University College, Colombo (later to become the University of Ceylon), Peiris was a Member of the Advisory Council of the new University College.\n\n\n== Family & personal life ==\nIn 1889, Peiris married Grace de Mel, daughter of Jacob de Mel (1839-1919) and Dona Helena n\u00e9e Ferdinando (1850-1906) and had two sons and two daughters; Ethel, Louise, Leonard and Devar Suriya Sena. His nephews were artist Harold Peiris and Bishop Lakdasa De Mel. He was a devoted Christian and a standing committee member of the Church of England synod. He was a Fellow of the Colonial Institute, a President of the Sinhalese Sports Club, founding Secretary of the Royal College Union, member of the Orient Club, founder of the Ceylon Social Service League, the Ceylon Social Reform Association, the Cheshire Home and the Low-Country Products' Association. He was also known for his ability and interest in horsemanship and farming.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nPeiris is considered as one of the few distinguished Sri Lankan statesmen prior to its independence and is often referred to as the Father of Constitutional Reforms. Those vindicated due to his efforts became the subsequent leaders of the nation. When his portrait was unveiled in Parliament, the then Prime Minister, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike stated:\n\"Like Moses, James Peiris brought his people within sight of the promised land, but did not live to see its fulfilment\". \nIn his honour one of the major streets in Colombo is named Sir James Peiris Mawatha and so is Sir James Peiris Hall a Hall of Residence at the University of Peradeniya.

It aims to redevelop unused and affordable industrial buildings into space for new businesses, especially for the \"six pillar industries\".\n\n\n== Objectives ==\nThe project has three main measures: \n\nLower the ownership application threshold for compulsory sale for redevelopment from 90% to 80%.\nGive owners options to pay for the assessed land premium by financing at a fixed rate of 2% over five years.\nCreate a tailor-made lease modification which provides land premium based on their most suitable use.The government continues to provide art space at favorable industrial premises. From 2010 to 2013, 13 applications for redevelopment and 49 for wholesale conversion have been approved and it has supplied about 680,000 square meters of non-industrial use area.\n\n\n== Distribution and type of business ==\nIndustrial buildings are located broadly throughout Hong Kong and there are varying concentrations of types of businesses. The following are some examples of clustering:\nKwun Tong: movie post-production offices and music studios\nSan Po Kong: performing arts stages\nChai Wan: photo studios\nFo Tan: visual arts studiosOther types of businesses include sports (e.g. skiing, snowboard, baseball, softball and football facilities), creative arts workshops (e.g. leather workshop, painting, sculpture, music), restaurants and farms (e.g. aquatic farm and hydroponics plantation).\n\n\n== Impact ==\n\n\n=== Positive impact ===\nProviding land for various land uses\nConsidering that land space in Hong Kong is scarce in relation to its population, continuous development is needed to keep up with growth. To manage the need for commercial and residential space, old industrial buildings are being converted into offices, residential areas, hotels and other uses. This is also especially useful for cultural and creative industries that may require large commercial space. The Jockey Club Creative Arts Centre (JCCAC) is an example. The building renovated for JCCAC was a factory estate in Shek Kip Mei, which has been abandoned since the 1990s. It was converted into an arts centre for cultural development, and it has work space for more than 100 artists and arts groups. Additionally, it is cheaper and fast to renovate old buildings is faster than constructing new ones.Minimising construction waste and costs\nRevitalizing old industrial buildings prevents demolition, minimizing construction waste and land pollution.\n\n\n=== Negative impact ===\nIncrease in rental fee\nThe Policy of Revitalizing industrial buildings resulted in an increase in rental fees, increasing the rateable value 2% in 2012 and 7% in 2013. A survey conducted in 2010 by the Hong Kong Arts Development Council (HKADC) showed that over 60% of industrial buildings users had problems as a result of rental increases. The average increase was 14%. According to the recent survey proposed by HKADC, among 800 arts groups renting space in industrial buildings, 61.5% stated that they were facing an increase in rental fee, which poses a financial threat to arts groups who have unstable income. Their rental fee, including cost of installing air conditioners and other equipment, accounts, for the largest part of their expenses. Some arts groups or arts practitioners choose to relocate from the old industrial buildings as a result.Limitations on current Land Use Policy\nIn accordance with the Hong Kong Development Bureau town planning laws, cultural and creative industries (e.g. information technology, design and media production office, audio-visual recording studio, etc.) are allowed in these two zones. Nonetheless, Ms Leung Po Shan, the spokesperson of the Factory Artists Concern Group (FAC) stated that drama groups were not allowed to rent in factories.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPublic factory estates in Hong Kong\nManufacturing in Hong Kong\nAdaptive reuse\nHeritage conservation in Hong Kong\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFotanian (\u4f19\u70ad)\n(in Chinese) \u5de5\u5ec8\u85dd\u8853\u5bb6\u95dc\u6ce8\u7d44-website of Factory Artists Concern Group\nThe Jockey Club Creative Arts Centre (JCCAC)", "A production\u2013possibility frontier (PPF) or production possibility curve (PPC) is a curve which shows various combinations of set of two goods which can be produced with the given resources and technology where the given resources are fully and efficiently utilized per unit time.  One good can only be produced by diverting resources from other goods, and so by producing less of them. This tradeoff is usually considered for an economy, but also applies to each individual, household, and economic organization.\nGraphically bounding the production set for fixed input quantities, the PPF curve shows the maximum possible production level of one commodity for any given production level of the other, given the existing state of technology. By doing so, it defines productive efficiency in the context of that production set: a point on the frontier indicates efficient use of the available inputs (such as points B, D and C in the graph), a point beneath the curve (such as A) indicates inefficiency, and a point beyond the curve (such as X) indicates impossibility.\n\nPPFs are normally drawn as bulging upwards or outwards from the origin (\"concave\" when viewed from the origin), but they can be represented as bulging downward (inwards) or linear (straight), depending on a number of assumptions. A PPF illustrates several economic concepts, such as scarcity of resources (the fundamental economic problem that all societies face), opportunity cost (or marginal rate of transformation), productive efficiency, allocative efficiency, and economies of scale.\nAn outward shift of the PPC results from growth of the availability of inputs, such as physical capital or labour, or from technological progress in knowledge of how to transform inputs into outputs. Such a shift reflects, for instance, economic growth of an economy already operating at its full productivity (on the PPF), which means that more of both outputs can now be produced during the specified period of time without sacrificing the output of either good. Conversely, the PPF will shift inward if the labour force shrinks, the supply of raw materials is depleted, or a natural disaster decreases the stock of physical capital.\nHowever, most economic contractions reflect not that less can be produced but that the economy has started operating below the frontier, as typically, both labour and physical capital are underemployed, remaining therefore idle.\n\n\n== Properties ==\n\n\n=== Efficiency ===\n\nProduction-Possibility Frontier delineates the maximum amount/quantities of outputs (goods/services) an economy can achieve, given fixed resources (factors of production) and fixed technological progress.\n\nPoints that lie either on or below the production possibilities frontier/curve are possible/attainable: the quantities can be produced with currently available resources and technology.\nPoints that lie above the production possibilities frontier/curve are not possible/unattainable because the quantities cannot be produced using currently available resources and technology.\nPoints that lie strictly below the frontier/curve are inefficient, because the economy can produce more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good, with existing resources and technology.\nPoints that lie on the frontier/curve are efficient.Specifically, at all points on the frontier, the economy achieves productive efficiency: no more output of any good can be achieved from the given inputs without sacrificing output of some good.\nSome productive efficient points are Pareto efficient: impossible to find any trade that will make no consumer worse off. Pareto efficiency is achieved when the marginal rate of transformation (slope of the frontier/opportunity cost of goods) is equal to all consumers' marginal rate of substitution.\nSimilarly, not all Paleto efficient points on the frontier are Allocative efficient. Allocative efficient is only achieved when the economy produces at quantities that match societal preference.\n\n\n=== Efficiency ===\n\nA PPF (production possibility frontier) typically takes the form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that it would be impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.\nFor example, if one assumes that the economy's available quantities of factors of production do not change over time and that technological progress does not occur, if the economy is operating on the PPF, production of guns would need to be sacrificed to produce more butter. If production is efficient, the economy can choose between combinations (points) on the PPF: B if guns are of interest, C if more butter is needed, D if an equal mix of butter and guns is required.In the PPF, all points on the curve are points of maximum  productive efficiency (no more output of any good can be achieved from the given inputs without sacrificing output of some good); all points inside the frontier (such as A) can be produced but are productively inefficient; all points outside the curve (such as X) cannot be produced with the given, existing resources. Not all points on the curve are Pareto efficient, however; only in the case where the marginal rate of transformation is equal to all consumers' marginal rate of substitution and hence equal to the ratio of prices will it be impossible to find any trade that will make no consumer worse off.Any point that lies either on the production possibilities curve or to the left of it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie to the right of the production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.\n\n\n=== Opportunity cost ===\n\nFrom a starting point on the frontier, if there is no increase in productive resources, increasing production of a first good entails decreasing production of a second, because resources must be transferred to the first and away from the second. Points along the curve describe the tradeoff between the goods. The sacrifice in the production of the second good is called the opportunity cost (because increasing production of the first good entails losing the opportunity to produce some amount of the second). Opportunity cost is measured in the number of units of the second good forgone for one or more units of the first good.In the context of a PPF, opportunity cost is directly related to the shape of the curve (see below). If the shape of the PPF curve is a straight-line, the opportunity cost is constant as production of different goods is changing. But, opportunity cost usually will vary depending on the start and end points. In the diagram on the right, producing 10 more packets of butter, at a low level of butter production, costs the loss of 5 guns (shown as a movement from A to B). At point C, the economy is already close to its maximum potential butter output. To produce 10 more packets of butter, 50 guns must be sacrificed (as with a movement from C to D). The ratio of gains to losses is determined by the marginal rate of transformation.\n\n\n=== Marginal rate of transformation ===\n\nThe slope of the production\u2013possibility frontier (PPF) at any given point is called the marginal rate of transformation (MRT). The slope defines the rate at which production of one good can be redirected (by reallocation of productive resources) into production of the other. It is also called the (marginal) \"opportunity cost\" of a commodity, that is, it is the opportunity cost of X in terms of Y at the margin. It measures how much of good Y is given up for one more unit of good X or vice versa. The shape of a PPF is commonly drawn as concave to the origin to represent increasing opportunity cost with increased output of a good. Thus, MRT increases in absolute size as one moves from the top left of the PPF to the bottom right of the PPF.The marginal rate of transformation can be expressed in terms of either commodity. The marginal opportunity costs of guns in terms of butter is simply the reciprocal of the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms of guns. If, for example, the (absolute) slope at point BB in the diagram is equal to 2, to produce one more packet of butter, the production of 2 guns must be sacrificed. If at AA, the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms of guns is equal to 0.25, the sacrifice of one gun could produce four packets of butter, and the opportunity cost of guns in terms of butter is 4.\n\n\n== Shape ==\nThe production-possibility frontier can be constructed from the contract curve in an Edgeworth production box diagram of factor intensity. The example used above (which demonstrates increasing opportunity costs, with a curve concave to the origin) is the most common form of PPF. It represents a disparity, in the factor intensities and technologies of the two production sectors. That is, as an economy specializes more and more into one product (such as moving from point B to point D), the opportunity cost of producing that product increases, because we are using more and more resources that are less efficient in producing it. With increasing production of butter, workers from the gun industry will move to it. At first, the least qualified (or most general) gun workers will be transferred into making more butter, and moving these workers has little impact on the opportunity cost of increasing butter production: the loss in gun production will be small. However, the cost of producing successive units of butter will increase as resources that are more and more specialized in gun production are moved into the butter industry.If opportunity costs are constant, a straight-line (linear) PPF is produced. This case reflects a situation where resources are not specialised and can be substituted for each other with no added cost. Products requiring similar resources (bread and pastry, for instance) will have an almost straight PPF and so almost constant opportunity costs. More specifically, with constant returns to scale, there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if there was only one factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve. With varying returns to scale, however, it may not be entirely linear in either case.With economies of scale, the PPF would curve inward, with the opportunity cost of one good falling as more of it is produced. Specialization in producing successive units of a good determines its opportunity cost (say from mass production methods or specialization of labor).\n\n\n== Position ==\n\nThe two main determinants of the position of the PPF at any given time are the state of technology and management expertise (which are reflected in the available production functions) and the available quantities of factors of production (materials, direct labor, and factory overhead).\nOnly points on or within a PPF are actually possible to achieve in the short run. In the long run, if technology improves or if the supply of factors of production increases, the economy's capacity to produce both goods increases; if this potential is realized, economic growth occurs. That increase is shown by a shift of the production-possibility frontier to the right. Conversely, a natural, military or ecological disaster might move the PPF to the left in response to a reduction in an economy's productive capability.  Thus all points on or within the curve are part of the production set: combinations of goods that the economy could potentially produce.\nIf the two production goods depicted are capital investment (to increase future production possibilities) and current consumption goods, the higher the investment this year, the more the PPF would shift out in following years. Shifts of the curve can represent how technological progress that favors production possibilities of one good, say guns, more than the other shifts the PPF outwards more along the favored good's axis, \"biasing\" production possibilities in that direction. Similarly, if one good makes more use of say capital and if capital grows faster than other factors, growth possibilities might be biased in favor of the capital-intensive good.\n\n\n== Other applications ==\nIn microeconomics, the PPF shows the options open to an individual, household, or firm in a two-good world. By definition, each point on the curve is productively efficient, but, given the nature of market demand, some points will be more profitable than others. Equilibrium for a firm will be the combination of outputs on the PPF that is most profitable.From a macroeconomic perspective, the PPF illustrates the production possibilities available to a nation or economy during a given period of time for broad categories of output. It is traditionally used to show the movement between committing all funds to consumption on the y-axis versus investment on the x-axis.  However, an economy may achieve productive efficiency without necessarily being allocatively efficient. Market failure (such as imperfect competition or externalities) and some institutions of social decision-making (such as government and tradition) may lead to the wrong combination of goods being produced (hence the wrong mix of resources being allocated between producing the two goods) compared to what consumers would prefer, given what is feasible on the PPF.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==", "Pristimantis buckleyi is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae.

The season started on January 5, but was suspended immediately and the league then absorbed the Ottawa and Shamrocks teams of the Canadian Hockey Association and the season continued from January 15 to March 15. Seven teams played 12 games each. The Ottawa Hockey Club played two Stanley Cup challenges during the season, but lost the Cup to their rivals the Montreal Wanderers who won the league championship and played a Cup challenge afterwards.\n\n\n== League business ==\nAfter the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) turned down the Wanderers' application to join, Wanderers' manager Jimmy Gardner, along with Renfrew's Ambrose O'Brien worked to put together enough teams to form a league. Gardner approached the Ottawa Senators of the Federal League to have an Ottawa entry, but the players decided to fold the team, rather than compete with the Ottawa Hockey Club. Gardner also approached the Mutual Street Rink of Toronto to form a professional team, but was turned down as the rink was fully booked.The league was founded on December 2, 1909, at a private meeting at 300 St. James Street, the headquarters of the Dominion Office and Store Fitting Limited in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. At this meeting four franchises were approved:\n\nWanderers (represented by P. J. Doran, R. R. Boon, Jimmy Gardner)\nRenfrew (represented by Ambrose O'Brien, George E. Martel, Jim Barnett)\nCobalt (Thomas C. Hare)\nHaileybury (Noah Timmins)Eddie McCafferty acted as secretary, and he also was representative of interests in Toronto. A franchise would be held for a future Toronto team. The NHA discussed organizing a team in Ottawa with the Ottawa Lacrosse Club and getting Montreal Le National to join the NHA. The Wanderers and Renfrew signed a pact not to merge with the CHA unless Cobalt and Haileybury were also admitted. The teams pledged a $1,000 bond to stay together.Two days later on December 4, the NHA held an organizing meeting at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal. The CHA was meeting at the hotel also, and a message was sent to the Ottawa, Shamrocks and Le National teams to seek a merged seven-team league. This was turned down by the CHA, which would not accept Cobalt and Haileybury. The CHA proposed that Renfrew and Wanderers join the CHA, but the NHA teams turned that proposal down.An executive was elected:\n\nPresident \u2013 M. Doheney, Renfrew\nVice-President \u2013 Thomas C. Hare, Cobalt\nSec.-Treasurer \u2013 E. John McCafferty\nExecutive \u2013 J. Ambrose O'Brien, Slaght, Boon, Jack Laviolette and Thomas C. HareAt the meeting, a franchise for 'Les Canadiens' was granted, to be organized by Jack Laviolette. Mr. Hare of Cobalt put up a security deposit for the franchise on the understanding that it would be transferred to Montreal French sportsmen as soon as possible.The NHA decided to run the league in a more business-like manner. The league decided to write a standard player's contract. McCafferty, who was also secretary of the Montreal Baseball Club, was to draw up the contract. The NHA also decided to have professional referees. Both of these were innovations in the world of ice hockey.\n\n\n== Regular season ==\nThe first Canadiens game ever took place on January 5 under a cloud. Didier Pitre had signed a contract with both the Canadiens and the Nationals. Pitre was risking a $2,000 fine and 60 days jail time. The Nationals had a legal injunction against Pitre playing for the Canadiens. This contributed to an over-capacity crowd at the Jubilee Rink of about 5,000. Pitre did play (he was guaranteed any fines by Canadiens' management) and court action commenced. Pitre was found to not to have a binding contract with the Nationals by the courts. By this time, the CHA had folded, and no contract was enforceable. Pitre would have a long career with the Canadiens, playing into the 1920s.On January 15, a meeting was held by the league executive and Ottawa and Montreal Shamrocks were admitted to the NHA. The games played before that date were thrown out, and games from that date forwards counted towards the final standings.On January 22, at a game between Renfrew and Shamrocks, Shamrock's Joe Hall was ejected for striking the judge-of-play Rod Kennedy. After regulation time, the game was tied. Referee Tom Hodge proposed that Hall return for the overtime, but Renfrew objected and did not play the overtime. Hall was later fined $100 for the incident and suspended until January 30. The game was ordered replayed but wasn't due to ice conditions and the game results were accepted as a tie.On Cyclone Taylor's first return to Ottawa as a member of the Renfrew team, he made his famous promise to score a goal backwards against Ottawa. This led to incredible interest, with over 7000 in attendance. A bet of $100 was placed at the King Edward Hotel against him scoring at all. The Senators would win 8\u20135 (3 goals in overtime) and more importantly keep Taylor off the scoresheet. Later in the season at the return match in Renfrew, Taylor made good on his boast with a goal scored backwards. This was the final game of the season, and the Senators had no chance at the league title, and don't appear to have put in an effort, losing 17\u20132.\n\n\n=== Final standings ===\nNote: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, GF= Goals For, GA = Goals Against\n\n\n== Stanley Cup challenges ==\nDuring the season Ottawa as Cup champion played a challenge against Edmonton in addition to their regular schedule.

In the Roman rite of the Catholic Church Tenebrae was celebrated in all churches with a sufficient number of clergy until the liturgical reforms of Pope Pius XII in the 1950s. The traditions regarding this service go back at least to the ninth century. Matins, originally celebrated a few hours after midnight, and lauds, originally celebrated at dawn, were anticipated by the late Middle Ages on the afternoon or evening of the preceding day, and were given the name \"Tenebrae\" because concluding when darkness was setting in.The celebration of matins and lauds of these days on the previous evening in the form referred to as Tenebrae in churches with a sufficient number of clergy was universal in the Roman Rite until the reform of the Holy Week ceremonies by Pope Pius XII in 1955. He restored the Easter Vigil as a night office, moving that Easter liturgy from Holy Saturday morning to the following night and likewise moved the principal liturgies of Holy Thursday and Good Friday from morning to afternoon or evening. Thus matins and lauds of Good Friday and Holy Saturday could no longer be anticipated on the preceding evening, and even matins and lauds of Holy Thursday was allowed to be anticipated only in the case of cathedral churches in which the Chrism Mass was held on Holy Thursday morning.The 1960 Code of Rubrics, which was incorporated in the next typical edition of the Roman Breviary, published on 5 April 1961, a year ahead of the publication of the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal, allowed no anticipation whatever of lauds, though matins alone could still be anticipated to the day before, later than the hour of vespers.In sum:\n\nUntil 1955 the three consecutive Tenebrae services for Holy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday, including the typical ceremonies such as the extinguishing of candles, with each of these three services anticipated on the previous evening, were widely celebrated as an integral part of the liturgy of Holy Week in churches with a sufficient number of clergy wherever the Roman rite was followed. A rich tradition of music composed for these central occasions had developed.\nFrom 1956 to 1970 the practice largely declined:\nThe 1955 papal document restored the celebration of matins and lauds of Holy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday to their original timing as morning services, with only a little allowance for anticipating any of them on the evening before. On these three days attention shifted from what became morning services to the services that were now to be held in the afternoon or evening. Communal celebration of matins and lauds became limited generally to communities that observed the full Divine Office in congregational form. Matins and lauds, having lost their exceptional character, provided composers with little incentive to produce new music for them and there was no demand for grand performances of the existing music earlier composed for Tenebrae.\nThe Roman Breviary, as updated in 1961, did not mention any specific Tenebrae ceremonies to accompany the no longer anticipated matins and lauds of Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday.\nFinally, in the wake of the Second Vatican Council, matins and lauds throughout the year were completely reformed. Matins, for instance, no longer had the nine psalms and lauds the five psalms that determined the number of candles extinguished in the Tenebrae celebration.\n\n\n==== Structure of the original Tenebrae ====\nThe structure is the same for all three days. The first part of the service is matins, which in its pre-1970 form is composed of three nocturns, each consisting of three psalms, a short versicle and response, a silent Pater Noster, and three readings, each followed by a responsory. The pre-1970 lauds consists of five psalms, a short versicle and response, and the Benedictus Gospel canticle, followed by Christus factus est, a silent Pater Noster, and the appointed collect. The Gloria Patri is not said after each psalm.The principal Tenebrae ceremony is the gradual extinguishing of candles upon a stand in the sanctuary called a hearse. Eventually, the Roman Rite settled on fifteen candles, one of which is extinguished after each of the nine psalms of matins and the five of lauds. The six altar candles are put out during the Benedictus, gradually reducing also the lighting in the church throughout the chanting of the canticle. Then any remaining lights in the church are extinguished and the last candle on the hearse is hidden behind the altar (if the altar is such as does not hide the light, the candle, still it, is put inside a candle lantern), ending the service in total darkness. The strepitus (Latin for \"great noise\"), made by slamming a book shut, banging a hymnal or breviary against the pew, or stomping on the floor, symbolizes the earthquake that followed Christ's death, although it may have originated as a simple signal to depart. After the candle has been shown to the people, it is extinguished, and then put \"on the credence table,\" or simply taken to the sacristy. All rise and then leave in silence.\n\n\n==== Table illustrating the contents of the service ====\nNote that the 1 November 1911 reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X radically reorganized the weekly recitation of the Psalter. In the Tridentine Roman Breviary of Pope Pius V (1568), Psalms 62/63 and 66/67 (treated as a single unit) and Psalms 148\u2212150 (again treated as a single unit) were recited at lauds every day of the week. Pius X eliminated such repetitions and provided a quite different choice of psalms for lauds.\nThe situation before the 1911 reform is illustrated in 19th-century publications such as Prosper Gu\u00e9ranger's Passiontide and Holy Week, (Dublin 1870) and The Complete Office of Holy Week According to the Roman Missal and Breviary, in Latin and English (Benziger 1875). It is more difficult to find similar online 20th-century publication, but the text of the Tenebrae services as reformed by Pope Pius X in 1911 is available in the 1924 edition of the Liber Usualis. The 1961 edition, with English rubrics and explanations, is available on more than one site.\n\n\n==== Music ====\n\nThe lessons of the first nocturn at matins are taken from the Lamentations of Jeremiah and are sung to a specific Gregorian reciting tone. The Lamentations of Jeremias have been set to music by many composers, including Palestrina, Tallis and Lassus. Such High-Renaissance polyphonic choral settings of Lamentations at Tenebrae, culminating in those of Lassus (1584), share the same texts with, but in musical idiom are to be distinguished from, the French Baroque genre of Le\u00e7ons de t\u00e9n\u00e8bres, as composed by Marc-Antoine Charpentier and Fran\u00e7ois Couperin. In the 20th century Ernst Krenek wrote a Lamentatio Jeremiae prophetae, Op. 93.\nThe lessons of the second nocturn are taken from the writings of St. Augustine, and the lessons of the third nocturn from two New Testament epistles. These are chanted to the ordinary lesson tone and have been relatively neglected by composers, though there are a few settings by Manuel Cardoso. The Tenebrae responsories have been set by, among others, Lassus, Gesualdo, Victoria, Marc-Antoine Charpentier and Jan Dismas Zelenka. Gregorio Allegri's setting of the Miserere psalm, to be sung at the Tenebrae Lauds, is one of the best known compositions for the service. Also Gesualdo includes a setting of that psalm in his Responsoria et alia ad Officium Hebdomadae Sanctae spectantia, along with a setting of the Benedictus.\n\n\n=== Roman Rite since 1970 ===\nAfter the 1970 revision of the Roman Breviary, now called the Liturgy of the Hours, a 1988 circular letter from the Congregation for Divine Worship recommended communal celebration of the Office of Readings and Morning Prayer \u2212 which were formerly called matins and lauds \u2212 on Good Friday and Holy Saturday, and remarked that this office was \"formerly called 'Tenebrae'\". The General Instruction of the Liturgy of the Hours says: \"Before morning Lauds on Good Friday and Holy Saturday, the Office of Readings is, if possible, to be celebrated publicly and with the people taking part.\" The Ceremonial of Bishops (1984) says: \"It is also desirable that, if at all possible, the bishop take part with the clergy and people in the office of readings and morning prayer on Good Friday and Holy Saturday.\" The Office of Readings and Morning Prayer have only 6 psalms (3 in either hour), not the older form's 14, after each of which a candle was extinguished. The readings are no longer 3, divided into 9 sections, but 2 longer readings, and there is provision for extending the Office of Readings on more solemn occasions. In the older form, liturgical practice on those days differed from that on other days, even those of Lent: for instance, Gloria Patri was not included at the end of psalms and responsories. The office of Tenebrae was abandoned at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem only in 1977 \u2212 although the rule against anticipation of Matins and Lauds to the previous evening was already in effect there \u2212 because the times of Catholic Holy Week services had to remain unchanged due to the established rights of other churches.Summorum Pontificum (2007) permits clerics bound to recitation of the Divine Office to use the 1961 Roman Breviary, a permission availed of by several religious and secular institutes and societies of apostolic life. The 1955 and 1960 changes incorporated in that edition of the Breviary continue to exclude anticipation of matins and lauds to the previous evening, whether celebrated with or without the Tenebrae ceremonies. \nTenebrae-like services continue even where the 1961 Roman Breviary is not used:\n\nThe Jesuit Institute provides a service, denominated Tenebrae, without psalms and not necessarily in darkness, in which a candle is extinguished after the reading of each of seven Scripture passages related to the Passion of Jesus.\nA modified form of the old-style Tenebrae that leaves the church in darkness is used by the Canons Regular of Saint John Cantius in Chicago.\nSeveral Catholic cathedrals and other churches arrange one-off services with Gregorian chant and polyphonic music from the traditional Tenebrae service, sometimes as an evening concert.\n\n\n== Other Western Christian Churches ==\n\nSome Protestant denominations retained elements of the Roman Tenebrae liturgy, or added others. The name \"tenebrae\" can be given to various Holy Week services held by Protestant churches including the Lutheran, Anglican, United Methodist, United Church of Christ and Presbyterian Churches.  Some liturgical Baptist congregations also hold Tenebrae Services. Variations of Tenebrae are sometimes celebrated in less formal or non-denominational churches as well.\nSome Tenebrae responsory settings led their own life in Protestant practice, for instance:\n\nJacob Handl's Ecce quomodo moritur justus\nThe Tristis est anima mea setting attributed to Johann Kuhnau\n\n\n=== Anglican practice ===\nSome Anglican churches celebrate the Tenebrae service, thereby preserving the importance of the Maundy Thursday and Good Friday observances.\nThe Episcopal Church in its Book of Occasional Services provides for a single Tenebrae service on Holy Wednesday in the evening. That service preserves the number of nine Tenebrae lessons, each followed by a responsory.The majority of parishes within the Anglican Church of Canada do not routinely celebrate Tenebrae, and the Anglican Book Centre does not publish any service explicitly for Tenebrae. Parishes that do celebrate Tenebrae follow a variety of practices. The Church of St. Mary Magdalene (Toronto) is notable for the excellence of its music, of which the musical Tenebrae services are exemplary. At the Church of the Epiphany (Oakville) Tenebrae is described as the reversal of the Advent wreath: \"starting Lent with the brightness of six candles, the darkness grows as a candle is extinguished each week in anticipation of Jesus dying on the cross on Good Friday.\"  This abbreviated Tenebrae liturgy begins worship services on Sundays during Lent.  The Sisterhood of Saint John the Divine have their own liturgy, \"The Order of Tenebrae\", published in 1933. \n\n\n=== Lutheran practice ===\nIn Lutheran churches that observe the celebration, the Tenebrae service is typically held on Good Friday. There is a gradual dimming of the lights and extinguishing of the candles as the service progresses. Toward the end of the service, the Christ candle, if present, is removed from the sanctuary. A concluding Strepitus, or loud noise, typically made by slamming shut the Bible, is made, symbolizing the earthquake that took place, and the agony of creation, at the death of Christ.\n\n\n=== Methodist practice ===\nIn the Methodist tradition, fourteen candles, along with a central Christ candle, are lit on the Tenebrae hearse after the Opening Prayer. They are consequently extinguished after each of the Tenebrae lessons. Prior to the reading of the sixteenth lesson, the Christ candle on the Tenebrae hearse is extinguished and then the church bells are tolled. The sixteenth lesson is read in darkness, followed by the conclusion of the liturgy.\n\n\n=== Polish National Catholic practice ===\nThe Polish National Catholic service usually takes place on Good Friday, mostly at night. A standing cross is put on the altar with a black veil over it and 12 to 14 candles are placed behind it. The service has a combination of Bitter Lamentations, Matins, and Vespers.  Several of the PNCC clergy, vested with cantors, are seated at the high place and the service is chanted. Gradually a minor cleric puts out each candle except for the top one that is taken around the sanctuary into the vestry. At that time a moment of silence is held for Christ's death. Then the candle is placed back; the lights in the church are turned back on; and the final hymns are sung.\n\n\n=== Reformed practice ===\nCongregationalist versions of Tenebrae service, particularly on Maundy Thursday or Good Friday, often contain readings from the gospels which describe the time between the Last Supper and the Passion of Christ.\n\n\n== Orthodox practice ==\nSome Western Rite Orthodox parishes observe the service of Tenebrae.  Among some of the Byzantine Rite Orthodox there is an external similarity in that at Matins of Great Friday a candlestick with 12 candles is set up in the center of the temple behind the analogion from which the Twelve Passion Gospels are read. After each reading one of the candles is extinguished.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRoman Catholic devotions: Tenebrae\nAn Episcopal Tenebrae service\nTenebrae - Catholic Encyclopedia article\nTenebrae Hearse - Catholic Encyclopedia article\nPresbyterian Tenebrae Order of Service\nUnited Methodist Church Tenebrae\nSample non-denominational Tenebrae\nTenebrae (an Explanation) in St. Louis, MO\nTenebrae - The Jesuit Institute", "Mahmoud Abdel Aziz (Arabic: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u062f \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632\u200e\u200e; 4 June 1946 \u2013 12 November 2016) was an Egyptian movie and television actor.

Following her performances with the theater group Faces, Saldana made her screen debut in a 1999 episode of Law & Order.\nSaldana's film career began a year later with Center Stage (2000), where she played a struggling ballet dancer. Saldana's breakthrough came in 2009 with her first of multiple appearances as Nyota Uhura in the Star Trek film series and her first appearance as Neytiri in the Avatar film series. She also portrays Gamora in multiple films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with Guardians of the Galaxy (2014).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSaldana was born in Passaic, New Jersey. Her father, Aridio Salda\u00f1a, was Dominican, while her mother, Asalia Nazario, is Puerto Rican. She was christened Zoe Yadira Salda\u00f1a Nazario, reflecting both her parents\u2019 surnames. Saldana also has Lebanese and Haitian roots. With regard to her racial identity, Saldana stated, \"There's no one way to be black. I'm black the way I know how to be.\" She spent the majority of her early childhood growing up in Jackson Heights, New York. She was raised bilingual, speaking English and Spanish. She has two sisters, Cisely and Mariel. Their father died in a car crash when Zoe was 9 years old, and their mother subsequently moved with the children to the Dominican Republic.Saldana discovered her love of dance in the Dominican Republic and enrolled in the ECOS Espacio de Danza Academy; she studied various forms of dance, but describes ballet as her first passion. She told Vanity Fair that she quit ballet because she did not \"have the feet\" and had too much pride and ambition to just be in the corps de ballet. The family returned to New York after her sophomore year in high school. In 1995, she began performing with the Faces theater group in Brooklyn, which put on plays geared toward providing positive messages for teens via themes dealing with issues such as substance abuse and adolescent sexuality. Concurrently, she performed with the New York Youth Theater; her appearance in their production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat led a talent agency to recruit her. Her previous dance training, and her acting experience, helped her land her first film role, playing talented and headstrong ballet student Eva Rodriguez in Center Stage (2000).\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\n\nSaldana was still a member of Faces when she gained exposure in an episode of Law & Order (titled \"Refuge, Part 2\") which first aired in 1999. Saldana's first film role was in Center Stage (2000), directed by Nicholas Hytner, about a group of young dancers from various backgrounds who enroll at the fictitious American Ballet Academy in New York City. She then appeared in the Britney Spears vehicle Crossroads (2002). The film was met with negative reviews from critics, but became somewhat of a box office success. The same year, Saldana starred in the comedy-drama Drumline (2002), alongside Nick Cannon, which was met with generally favorable reviews.\nIn Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), she played Anamaria, a female pirate who signs up to join Will Turner and Mr. Gibbs for a chance to confront Jack Sparrow for stealing her ship. As to why she never appeared in any further films in the franchise, Saldana revealed that she almost quit acting following \"disrespectful treatment\" on set of the film. She then appeared in The Terminal as Dolores Torres, an immigration officer and Star Trek fan, a role that would later help Saldana when she came to appear in the Star Trek reboot (2009). In 2004, she also made appearances in Haven and Temptation, both of which had little to no box office success.\nIn 2005, Saldana appeared in Constellation, Guess Who with Ashton Kutcher, and Dirty Deeds. She then starred in the romantic comedy-dramas Premium (2006) and After Sex (2007). The same year, Saldana starred in Blackout, a television film set in New York City during the Northeast Blackout of 2003. The film premiered at the 2007 Zurich Film Festival and debuted on BET in 2008. Saldana also had a small role as Angie Jones in the action thriller Vantage Point (2008).\n\n\n=== Breakthrough ===\n\nSaldana appeared in two roles in 2009, which both went on to raise her profile considerably. She played Nyota Uhura in Star Trek. The film's director J. J. Abrams asked Saldana to play the role because he had seen and liked her previous work. Saldana had never seen the original series, though she had played a Trekkie in The Terminal (2004), but agreed to play the role after Abrams complimented her. She met with Nichelle Nichols, who explained to her how she had created Uhura's background and named the character. Saldana's mother was a Star Trek fan and sent her voicemails during filming, giving advice on the role. Steven Spielberg taught her the Vulcan salute five years earlier when he directed her in The Terminal. Star Trek (2009) was a box office success grossing $385.7 million.Saldana's second high-profile film in 2009 was James Cameron's Avatar, in which she played the alien hunter Neytiri. Avatar was well-received by critics, accumulating an approval rating of 83% on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. It grossed $2.7 billion worldwide to become the highest-grossing film of all time, as well as in the United States and Canada. It also became the first film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide. The film was nominated for ten Saturn Awards and won all ten at the 36th Saturn Awards ceremony. Saldana's Saturn Award for Best Actress win marked a rare occurrence for an all-CG character.\n\nIn 2010, Saldana performed in The Losers as Aisha al-Fadhil, a native Bolivian woman. For the role, she was required to gain weight, as she was expected to carry weapons around for eight hours a day. In 2010, she also appeared in Takers, Death at a Funeral and Burning Palms. Her television ad for Calvin Klein's \"Envy\" line also debuted in 2010. In 2011, Saldana starred in the romantic comedy The Heart Specialist and played Cataleya Restrepo, a professional assassin, in the crime drama Colombiana. While the latter film was met with negative reviews from critics, Saldana's performance was praised.In 2012, she appeared in the romantic drama The Words, which also received negative reviews from critics and saw little success at the box office.In 2013, Saldana reprised her role as Uhura in Star Trek Into Darkness, the sequel to the Star Trek reboot. Like the previous film, it was a box office success ending its North American theatrical run with a box office total of $228,778,661, placing it as the 11th highest-grossing film for 2013. It also earned $467,365,246 worldwide, ranking it in 14th place for 2013 and making it the highest-grossing film of the franchise.  Saldana also voiced her character in the 2013 release of the Star Trek video game.\nIn 2014, Saldana played Gamora in the hit film Guardians of the Galaxy. Saldana said that she became Gamora through make-up rather than computer generated imagery (CGI) or performance capture. The film became the third highest-grossing film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, behind The Avengers and Iron Man 3. It was the third highest-grossing 2014 film (behind Transformers: Age of Extinction and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, and the highest-grossing superhero film of 2014.The film was met with positive reviews and Saldana was nominated for numerous awards including Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie, Favorite Action Movie Actress at the People's Choice Awards and Best On-Screen Transformation at the MTV Movie Awards.In May 2014, she performed in Rosemary's Baby, a television miniseries adaptation of Ira Levin's horror novel. Saldana also co-produced the four-hour, two-part show.\nIn 2014, Saldana was recognized by Elle magazine during The Women in Hollywood Awards, honoring women for their outstanding achievements in film, spanning all aspects of the motion picture industry, including acting, directing, and producing.\n\n\n=== 2016\u2013present ===\nSaldana starred in Nina, an unauthorized biopic about the jazz musician Nina Simone, which was released in 2016. The film depicts the late singer's rise to fame and relationship with her manager Clifton Henderson. Simone's family has been critical of the decision to cast her in the role. Also in 2016, she co-starred in the science-fiction sequel Star Trek Beyond, which was released in July, and Ben Affleck's crime drama Live by Night, which was released in December.Saldana returned as Gamora in the Guardians of the Galaxy sequel, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), which was released in May. She again reprised the role in the sequel Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and in Avengers: Endgame, which is scheduled to be released in 2019.\nAlso in 2017, Saldana played Mrs. Moll\u00e9 in I Kill Giants, Anders Walter's adaptation of Joe Kelly's graphic novel I Kill Giants. Shooting commenced in Ireland in September 2016. Also that year, she appeared in My Little Pony: The Movie, where she performed the voice of pirate parrot Captain Celaeno.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIn June 2010, Saldana became engaged to her longtime boyfriend Keith Britton, an actor and the CEO of My Fashion Database. Saldana and Britton announced in November 2011 that they had ended their relationship after 11 years together.In March 2013, Saldana began dating Italian artist Marco Perego. They secretly married in June 2013 in London. In July 2015, Saldana revealed that, in a reversal of tradition, Perego adopted her surname upon marriage. Thereafter, Zoe became Zoe Saldana-Perego and Marco became Marco Perego-Saldana. Their children would be Perego-Saldana. Saldana and Perego have three sons together, twins born in November 2014 and the third born in February 2017. Saldana stated that her children will be bilingual as she and her husband plan to speak both Spanish and English around them.In July 2016, during an interview with Net-a-Porter's The Edit, Saldana revealed that she has Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease, along with her mother and sisters. To combat the effects of this disease, Saldana said she and her husband adhere to a gluten- and dairy-free diet.In 2009, Saldana said she would avoid plastic surgery, telling Women's Health magazine \"God as my witness, I am going to try to do everything I can to keep this ass together for as long as I possibly can\u2014without going against nature.\" She watches what she eats but does not diet and does Pilates regularly saying \"It's the closest thing to dance.\"Saldana is a supporter of FINCA International, a microfinance organization.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Video games ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nZoe Saldana\nZoe Saldana on IMDb \nZoe Saldana at the TCM Movie Database \nZoe Saldana at AllMovie\nZoe Saldana, at Future Movies\n\"Zoe Saldana Shines on ESSENCE's April Cover\".

The community, with approximately 50,000 residents, encompasses over 9,500 residential houses in 61 neighborhoods located across southern parts of Sugar Land with a few neighborhoods spanning into Missouri City.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFirst Colony was developed by Sugarland Properties Inc.\u2014a joint venture of Gerald D. Hines Interests and Stichting Shell Pension Fund. Hines' Sugarland group began development on First Colony in 1976.When First Colony was under development in 1977, very little development was in the area. Bill Schadewald said that he, as a rookie real estate reporter, received speculation from local sources questioning whether \"a project so large and such a distance could succeed.\"The community was a census-designated place in the 1990 census, with a population of 18,327 in 5,976 housing units with a reported area of 9.3 square miles (24 km2). At the time, this made First Colony CDP the 108th most populous place in Texas.\nSugar Land gradually annexed most of its portion of First Colony within its municipal boundaries during the early to mid 1990s. For instance, the annexation of Municipal Utility District (MUD) 12 in First Colony occurred on December 17, 1991; this included 1,064 acres (4.31 km2), including 2,314 homes, 433 condominiums and 350,000 square feet (33,000 m2) of commercial property along Texas Highway 6.The Sugar Land Town Square, a development that began in the 2000s, was developed on one of the few remaining parcels of land in First Colony. In 2011 Schadewald said \"Now: I guess it\u2019s safe to say First Colony has been a success.\"\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nSeveral restrictions are placed on the development of commercial businesses. Signs of businesses within First Colony cannot be placed on poles. Exterior aesthetics common to retail businesses (from department store exteriors to restaurants) must have a brick-covered exterior and white lettering. As a result, fast food restaurants in First Colony differ in appearance from fast food restaurants in other areas. Steve Ewbank, the executive vice president of Planned Community Developers, the developer of First Colony, said that a brick shopping center in First Colony had a price tag higher by 10 to 20 percent than the price of typical shopping center.One community located in First Colony is Sweetwater, described by Ralph Bivins of the Houston Chronicle as \"upscale\". In the year 1990, four very expensive houses were sold, altogether worth 1.8 million dollars (3451910.34 in today's money). In the year 1991, until July 7 of that year, 12 houses priced at over $400,000 (735792.82 in today's money) were sold, with a total of $7.1 million (13060322.50 in today's money), three times that of the 1990 total. The most expensive house that was sold in 1991 (until July 7) was a 6,900 square feet (640 m2), $1.2 million (2207378.45 in today's money) house that was a replica of Melrose. It was in proximity to the Sweetwater Country Club and golf course.\n\n\n== Government and infrastructure ==\n\nThe City of Sugar Land City Hall is located in Sugar Land Town Square in First Colony.The United States Postal Service operates the First Colony Post Office in Sugar Land.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nMinute Maid opened its headquarters in Sugar Land Town Square in First Colony on February 16, 2009; previously it was headquartered in 2000 St. James Place in Houston.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\nFirst Colony is within the Fort Bend Independent School District.Elementary schools within First Colony and within Sugar Land include Austin Parkway, Colony Bend, Colony Meadows, Highlands, Lexington Creek, and Settlers Way. Other elementary schools serving sections of First Colony include Dulles Elementary School in Sugar Land, Lakeview Elementary School in Sugar Land, and Quail Valley Elementary School in Missouri City.Most of First Colony is served by First Colony Middle School in First Colony and in Sugar Land. Other middle schools serving sections of First Colony include Dulles Middle School in Sugar Land, Fort Settlement Middle School in Sugar Land, Quail Valley Middle School in Missouri City, and Sugar Land Middle School in Sugar Land.
